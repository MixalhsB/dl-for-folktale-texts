Cat and mouse in partnership
A cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse, and had said so much to her about the great love and friendship that he felt for her, that at last the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together. "But we must make preparations for winter, or else we shall suffer from hunger," said the cat, "and you, little mouse, cannot venture out everywhere, or in the end you will be caught in a trap." This good advice was followed, and they bought a pot of fat, but they did not know where to store it. Finally, after much consideration, the cat said, "I know of no place where it will be better stored up than in the church. No one dares take anything away from there. We will put it beneath the altar, and not touch it until we are need it." So the pot was stored safely away, but it was not long before the cat took a great longing for it, and said to the mouse, "I wanted to tell you, little mouse, that my cousin has brought a little son into the world, and she has asked me to be his godfather. He is white with brown spots, and I am to hold him over the baptismal font. Let me go out today, and you look after the house by yourself." - "Yes, yes," answered the mouse. "By all means go, and if you get anything good to eat, think of me. I would like to drink a drop of sweet red christening wine myself." All this, however, was untrue. The cat had no cousin, and had not been asked to be godfather. He went straight to the church, crept up to the pot of fat, began to lick at it, and licked off the top of the fat. Then he went for a stroll on the roofs of the town, looked out for opportunities, and then stretched out in the sun, licking his whiskers whenever he thought of the pot of fat. He did not return home until it was evening. "Well, here you are again," said the mouse. "You must have had a happy day." - "Everything went well," answered the cat. "What name did they give the child?" asked the mouse. "Top-Off," said the cat quite coolly. "Top-Off?" cried the mouse. "That is a very odd and uncommon name. Is it a usual one in your family?" - "What does that matter?" said the cat. "It is no worse than Crumb-Thief, as your godchildren are called."<p>Before long the cat was seized by another fit of longing. He said to the mouse, "You must do me a favor, and once more manage the house alone for a day. I have been asked again to be godfather, and since the child has a white ring around its neck, I cannot refuse." The good mouse consented. However, the cat crept behind the town wall to the church, and devoured half the pot of fat. "Nothing tastes as good as that which one eats by oneself," he said, and was quite satisfied with his day&#039;s work. When he arrived home the mouse asked, "What name was this child christened with?" - "Half-Gone," answered the cat. "Half-Gone? What are you saying? I have never heard that name in all my life. I&#039;ll wager it is not in the almanac."<p>The cat&#039;s mouth soon again began to water for the delicious goods. "All good things come in threes," he said to the mouse. "I have been asked to be godfather again. The child is totally black, only it has white paws. Otherwise it has not a single white hair on its whole body. This only happens once every few years. You will let me go, won&#039;t you?" - "Top-Off. Half-Gone," answered the mouse. "They are such odd names, that they make me stop and think." - "Here you sit at home," said the cat, "with your dark gray fur coat and long braid of hair capturing fantasies. That is because you do not go out in the daytime." During the cat&#039;s absence the mouse cleaned the house, and put it in order, but the greedy cat devoured all the rest of the fat. "One has peace only after everything is eaten up," he said to himself. Well filled and fat, he did not return home until nighttime. The mouse immediately asked what name had been given to the third child. "You will not like it either," said the cat. "His name is All-Gone." - "All-Gone!," cried the mouse. "That is the most worrisome name of all. I have never seen it in print. All-Gone! What can that mean?" Then she shook her head, curled herself up, and lay down to sleep.<p>From this time forth no one invited the cat to be godfather, but when winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found outside, the mouse thought of their stored food, and said, "Come cat, we will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves. It will taste good now." - "Yes," answered the cat. "You will enjoy it as much as you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the window." They set out on their way, but when they arrived, the pot of fat, to be sure, was still in its place, but it was empty. "Alas," said the mouse, "now I see what has happened. Now it comes to light. You are a true friend. You ate everything when you were serving as a godfather. First top off, then half done, then..." - "Be quiet!" cried the cat. "One more word, and I will eat you too."<p>"All gone," was already on the poor mouse&#039;s lips. She had scarcely spoken it before the cat sprang on her, seized her, and swallowed her down. You see, that is the way of the world.

Dragonfly and the Ant
A playful prankish Dragonfly <br>The whole Summer have sung out <br>Finally, she looked about;  <br>Winter &#039;s already coming by. <p>Like deceased the forest stays.   <br>Where are you, those happy days,   <br>When for her, under each tree,  <br>Was a home and tart with tea? <p>The evil Winter took all it,  <br>Leaving only some cold and need.   <br>The Dragonfly sings no more,  <br>As she used to do before.  <br>And who would, in times that sore?   <p>To escape th&#039;untimely end,   <br>She is creeping to an Ant  <br>With the bitter her lament.    <br>"Oh", she said, "My gentle friend,  <br> <br>I do beg you, be so dear,  <br>Do not leave me to die here,         <br>Give some shelter, food, and drink<br>For half-a-year, <br>Till the Spring". <p>"Did you work at all in Summer?" <br>Asked the Ant with a slight stammer,   <br>"Such a speech is strange to hear." <br>   <br>Dragonfly said, "Alas, my dear,  <br>No I didn&#039;t. Listen, I&#039;m... <br>Just I hadn&#039;t any time. <br>Whole Summer we were playing `and  <br>singing". "Well", answers the Ant,     <p>"Did you sing? <br>This is the thing! <br>Now, you&#039;ll have your chance <br>To dance."  <br>

Gossip wolf and the fox
The she-wolf brought forth a young one, and invited the fox to be godfather. "After all, he is a near relative of ours," said she, "he has a good understanding, and much talent; he can instruct my little son, and help him forward in the world." The fox, too, appeared quite honest, and said, "Worthy Mrs. Gossip, I thank you for the honour which you are doing me; I will, however, conduct myself in such a way that you shall be repaid for it." He enjoyed himself at the feast, and made merry; afterwards he said, "Dear Mrs. Gossip, it is our duty to take care of the child, it must have good food that it may be strong. I know a sheep-fold from which we might fetch a nice morsel." The wolf was pleased with the ditty, and she went out with the fox to the farm-yard. He pointed out the fold from afar, and said, "You will be able to creep in there without being seen, and in the meantime I will look about on the other side to see if I can pick up a chicken." He, however, did not go there, but sat down at the entrance to the forest, stretched his legs and rested. The she-wolf crept into the stable. A dog was lying there, and it made such a noise that the peasants came running out, caught Gossip Wolf, and poured a strong burning mixture, which had been prepared for washing, over her skin. At last she escaped, and dragged herself outside. There lay the fox, who pretended to be full of complaints, and said, "Ah, dear Mistress Gossip, how ill I have fared, the peasants have fallen on me, and have broken every limb I have; if you do not want me to lie where I am and perish, you must carry me away." The she-wolf herself was only able to go away slowly, but she was in such concern about the fox that she took him on her back, and slowly carried him perfectly safe and sound to her house. Then the fox cried to her, "Farewell, dear Mistress Gossip, may the roasting you have had do you good," laughed heartily at her, and bounded off.

Herr Korbes
There were once a cock and a hen who wanted to take a journey together. So the cock built a beautiful carriage, which had four red wheels, and harnessed four mice to it. The hen seated herself in it with the cock, and they drove away together. Not long afterwards they met a cat who said, "Where are you going?" The cock replied, "We are going to the house of Herr Korbes." - "Take me with you," said the cat. The cock answered, "Most willingly, get up behind, lest you fall off in front. Take great care not to dirty my little red wheels. And you little wheels, roll on, and you little mice pipe out, as we go forth on our way to the house of Herr Korbes."<p>After this came a millstone, then an egg, then a duck, then a pin, and at last a needle, who all seated themselves in the carriage, and drove with them. When, however, they reached the house of Herr Korbes, Herr Korbes was not there. The mice drew the carriage into the barn, the hen flew with the cock upon a perch. The cat sat down by the hearth, the duck on the well-pole. The egg rolled itself into a towel, the pin stuck itself into the chair-cushion, the needle jumped on to the bed in the middle of the pillow, and the millstone laid itself over the door. Then Herr Korbes came home, went to the hearth, and was about to light the fire, when the cat threw a quantity of ashes in his face. He ran into the kitchen in a great hurry to wash it off, and the duck splashed some water in his face. He wanted to dry it with the towel, but the egg rolled up against him, broke, and glued up his eyes. He wanted to rest, and sat down in the chair, and then the pin pricked him. He fell in a passion, and threw himself on his bed, but as soon as he laid his head on the pillow, the needle pricked him, so that he screamed aloud, and was just going to run out into the wide world in his rage, but when he came to the house-door, the millstone leapt down and struck him dead. Herr Korbes must have been a very wicked man!

Lion Share
Once there was a lion, a hyena, a fox, an ostrich and a hare, which together owned a bunch of camels. They took turns every day to bring the animals out to the pasture, except for the lion, who stayed home, because he was the king of beasts.<p>One day the fox and ostrich went out together to feed the camels. When the animals started grazing, Fox asked the ostrich, whether he would like to look after the animals, or would rather find Xabag for their lunch.<p>The ostrich chose to keep an eye on the camels, while the fox went off to collect lunch.<p>Fox wrapped the sticky mass of the Xabag around two stones.<p>"Go ahead," said the fox, "eat these two pieces of delicious Xabag".<p>The ostrich at once swallowed the two stones, which got stuck in its throat.<p>"Call the animals together and sing for them so we can get them home," said the fox.<p>"Wuu - uu - uu - mm," muttered the ostrich.<p>"You should not scare the camels," said the fox.<p>When they got home, Fox told the lion that the ostrich had frightened the camels.<p>"What &#039;s the matter with you?" asked the lion.<p>"Wu - uu - uu - mm," muttered the ostrich.<p>"See, he does it on purpose," said the fox.<p>The lion hit the ostrich and broke his neck.<p>The next day the fox the hare were asked to go herding the animals.<p>At noon the fox drank some milk of the milk that the lion had hidden in a secret place. The fox took a little of the cream and pretended to play with the hare and sprayed some cream on his lips.<p>"Who drank my milk? " the lion asked when they came home.<p>"I do not know, but the hare has cream on the lips," said the fox.<p>Lion discovered the cream of the hare&#039;s lips and killed him.<p>Next morning the lion killed one of the camels and invited all the animals to share the meat among themselves.<p>First he asked the hyena to divide the meat.<p>Hyena divided it into two halves.<p>"One half is for the lion and the other half is for the rest of us," said the hyena.<p>Lion was not happy with hyena&#039;s way of dividing the meat, and hit him on the side of his head. One of hyena&#039;s eyes fell out.<p>"Come here, fox, now you need to divide it," ordered the king.<p>"One third of the meat is for us, two-thirds are for the lion...... No, no. I make a new partition. Lion must have it all!" the fox concluded.<p>"Well, who taught you to share? " asked the lion amused.<p>"Hyena &#039;s drooping eye has taught me how to do it," said the fox.<p>One day Fox asked whether he would be allowed to make a new mat for the lion, because his old one was starting to wear down. In his stead, the lion could then take care of the camels that day.<p>Lion accepted the fox&#039;s proposals and shooed the animals out to pasture.<p>The fox dug a big hole inside the lion&#039;s cabin, filled it with hot charcoal and covered it over with branches and grass.<p>When the lion came home in the evening, the fox led him to his new mat and asked the lion lie down on it to try it. The lion lay down and fell into the burning charcoal, where he died.<p>Finally, the one-eyed hyena asked the fox to remove a blade of grass that had been in his eye.<p>"It&#039;s easy enough, come here, I&#039;ll take it out," said the fox.<p>The fox took a pointed stick and stuck hyena&#039;s other eye out and he went blind.<p>That is how the fox came to be the sole owner of the camels.

Old Sultan
A farmer once had a faithful dog called Sultan, who had grown old, and lost all his teeth, so that he could no longer hold anything fast. One day the farmer was standing with his wife before the house-door, and said, "To-morrow I intend to shoot Old Sultan, he is no longer of any use."<p>His wife, who felt pity for the faithful beast, answered, "He has served us so long, and been so faithful, that we might well give him his keep."<p>"Eh! what?" said the man. "You are not very sharp. He has not a tooth left in his mouth, and not a thief is afraid of him; now he may be off. If he has served us, he has had good feeding for it."<p>The poor dog, who was lying stretched out in the sun not far off, had heard everything, and was sorry that the morrow was to be his last day. He had a good friend, the wolf, and he crept out in the evening into the forest to him, and complained of the fate that awaited him. "Hark ye, gossip," said the wolf, "be of good cheer, I will help you out of your trouble. I have thought of something. To-morrow, early in the morning, your master is going with his wife to make hay, and they will take their little child with them, for no one will be left behind in the house. They are wont, during work-time, to lay the child under the hedge in the shade; you lay yourself there too, just as if you wished to guard it. Then I will come out of the wood, and carry off the child. You must rush swiftly after me, as if you would seize it again from me. I will let it fall, and you will take it back to its parents, who will think that you have saved it, and will be far too grateful to do you any harm; on the contrary, you will be in high favor, and they will never let you want for anything again."<p>The plan pleased the dog, and it was carried out just as it was arranged. The father screamed when he saw the Wolf running across the field with his child, but when Old Sultan brought it back, then he was full of joy, and stroked him and said, "Not a hair of yours shall be hurt, you shall eat my bread free as long as you live." And to his wife he said, "Go home at once and make Old Sultan some bread-sop that he will not have to bite, and bring the pillow out of my bed, I will give him that to lie upon."<p>Henceforth Old Sultan was as well off as he could wish to be.<p>Soon afterwards the wolf visited him, and was pleased that everything had succeeded so well. "But, gossip," said he, "you will just wink an eye if when I have a chance, I carry off one of your master&#039;s fat sheep." - "Do not reckon upon that," answered the dog; "I will remain true to my master; I cannot agree to that." The wolf, who thought that this could not be spoken in earnest, came creeping about in the night and was going to take away the sheep. But the farmer, to whom the faithful Sultan had told the wolf&#039;s plan, caught him and dressed his hide soundly with the flail. The wolf had to pack off, but he cried out to the dog, "Wait a bit, you scoundrel, you shall pay for this."<p>The next morning the wolf sent the boar to challenge the dog to come out into the forest so that they might settle the affair. Old Sultan could find no one to stand by him but a cat with only three legs, and as they went out together the poor cat limped along, and at the same time stretched out her tail into the air with pain.<p>The wolf and his friend were already on the spot appointed, but when they saw their enemy coming they thought that he was bringing a sabre with him, for they mistook the outstretched tail of the cat for one. And when the poor beast hopped on its three legs, they could only think every time that it was picking up a stone to throw at them. So they were both afraid; the wild boar crept into the under-wood and the wolf jumped up a tree.<p>The dog and the cat, when they came up, wondered that there was no one to be seen. The wild boar, however, had not been able to hide himself altogether; and one of his ears was still to be seen. Whilst the cat was looking carefully about, the boar moved his ear; the cat, who thought it was a mouse moving there, jumped upon it and bit it hard. The boar made a fearful noise and ran away, crying out, "The guilty one is up in the tree." The dog and cat looked up and saw the wolf, who was ashamed of having shown himself so timid, and made friends with the dog.

One&#039;s Own Children Are Always Prettiest
A SPORTSMAN went out once into a wood to shoot, and he met a Snipe.<p>"Dear friend," said the Snipe, "don&#039;t shoot my children?"<p>"How shall I know your children?" asked the Sports-man; "what are they like?"<p>"Oh!" said the Snipe, "mine are the prettiest children in all the wood."<p>"Very well," said the Sportsman, "I&#039;ll not shoot them; don&#039;t be afraid."<p>But for all that, when he came back, there he had a whole string of young snipes in his hand which he had shot.<p>"Oh! oh!" said the Snipe, "why did you shoot my children after all?"<p>"What, these your children!" said the Sportsman; "why, I shot the ugliest I could find, that I did!"<p>"Woe is me!" said the Snipe; "don&#039;t you know that each one thinks his own children the prettiest in the world?"<br>

Reynard And Chanticleer
Once on a time there was a Cock who stood on a dung-heap, and crew, and flapped his wings. Then the Fox came by.<p>&#039;Good day,&#039; said Reynard, &#039;I heard you crowing so nicely; but can you stand on one leg and crow, and wink your eyes?&#039;<p>&#039;Oh, yes,&#039; said Chanticleer. &#039;I can do that very well.&#039; So he stood on one leg and crew; but he winked only with one eye, and when he had done that he made himself big and flapped his wings, as though he had done a great thing.<p>&#039;Very pretty, to be sure,&#039; said Reynard. &#039;Almost as pretty as when the parson preaches in church; but can you stand on one leg and wink both your eyes at once? I hardly think you can.&#039;<p>&#039;Can&#039;t I though!&#039; said Chanticleer, and stood on one leg, and winked both his eyes, and crew. But Reynard caught hold of him, took him by the throat, and threw him over his back, so that he was off to the wood before he had crowed his crow out, as fast as Reynard could lay legs to the ground.<p>When they had come under an old spruce fir, Reynard threw Chanticleer on the ground, set his paw on his breast, and was going to take a bite!<p>&#039;You are a heathen, Reynard!&#039; said Chanticleer. &#039;Good Christians say grace, and ask a blessing before they eat.&#039;<p>But Reynard would be no heathen. God forbid it! So he let go his hold, and was about to fold his paws over his breast and say grace--but pop! up flew Chanticleer into a tree.<p>&#039;You sha&#039;n&#039;t get off for all that,&#039; said Reynard to himself. So he went away, and came again with a few chips, which the woodcutters had left. Chanticleer peeped and peered to see what they could be.<p>&#039;Whatever have you got there?&#039; he asked.<p>&#039;These are letters I have just got,&#039; said Reynard, &#039;won&#039;t you help me to read them, for I don&#039;t know how to read writing.&#039;<p>&#039;I&#039;d be so happy, but I dare not read them now; said Chanticleer; &#039;for here comes a hunter, I see him, I see him, as I sit by the tree trunk.&#039;<p>When Reynard heard Chanticleer chattering about a hunter, he took to his heels as quick as he could.<p>This time it was Reynard who was made game of.<br>

Straw, coal, and bean
An old woman lived in a village. She had gathered a serving of beans and wanted to cook them, so she prepared a fire in her fireplace. To make it burn faster she lit it with a handful of straw. While she was pouring the beans into the pot, one of them fell unnoticed to the floor, coming to rest next to a piece of straw. Soon afterward a glowing coal jumped out of the fireplace and landed next to them. The straw said, "Dear friends, where do you come from?" The coal answered, "I jumped from the fireplace, to my good fortune. If I had not forced my way out, I surely would have died. I would have burned to ash." The bean said, "I too saved my skin. If the old woman had gotten me into the pot I would have been cooked to mush without mercy, just like my comrades." - "Would my fate have been any better?" said the straw. "The old woman sent all my brothers up in fire and smoke. She grabbed sixty at once and killed them. Fortunately I slipped through her fingers." - "What should we do now?" asked the coal. "Because we have so fortunately escaped death," answered the bean, "I think that we should join together as comrades. To prevent some new misfortune from befalling us here, let us together make our way to another land."<p>This proposal pleased the other two, and they set forth all together. They soon came to a small brook, and because there was neither a bridge nor a walkway there, they did not know how they would get across it. Then the straw had a good idea, and said, "I will lay myself across it, and you can walk across me like on a bridge." So the straw stretched himself from one bank to the other. The coal, who was a hot-headed fellow, stepped brashly onto the newly constructed bridge, but when he got to the middle and heard the water rushing beneath him, he took fright, stopped, and did not dare to go any further. Then the straw caught fire, broke into two pieces, and fell into the brook. The coal slid after him, hissed as he fell into the water, and gave up the ghost. The bean who had cautiously stayed behind on the bank had to laugh at the event. He could not stop, and he laughed so fiercely that he burst. Now he too would have died, but fortunately a wandering tailor was there, resting near the brook. Having a compassionate heart, he got out a needle and thread and sewed the bean back together. The bean thanked him most kindly. However, because he had used black thread, since that time all beans have had a black seam.

The ant and the Grasshopper
In winter time, an ant dragged forth, to dry, <br>Some corn, by him last summer heap’d on high. <br>A starved grasshopper begg’d that he would give <br>Some share to it, lest it would cease to live. <br>“What did you,” asked he, “all the summer long?” <br>I lagg’d not, but was constant in my song.” <br>Laughing, the ant said, as he barr’d his wheat, <br>“Dance in the cold, since you sang in the heat!” <p>Of needful things ’tis better thought to take, <br>Than joy and revels our mind’s study make

The Ants and the Grasshopper
  THE ANTS were spending a fine winter&#039;s day drying grain collected in the summertime. A Grasshopper, perishing with famine, passed by and earnestly begged for a little food. The Ants inquired of him, "Why did you not treasure up food during the summer?&#039; He replied, "I had not leisure enough. I passed the days in singing." They then said in derision: "If you were foolish enough to sing all the summer, you must dance supperless to bed in the winter."

The Ass and the Grasshopper 
  AN ASS having heard some Grasshoppers chirping, was highly enchanted; and, desiring to possess the same charms of melody, demanded what sort of food they lived on to give them such beautiful voices. They replied, &quot;The dew.&quot; The Ass resolved that he would live only upon dew, and in a short time died of hunger.

The Ass and the Lapdog
  A MAN had an Ass, and a Maltese Lapdog, a very great beauty. The Ass was left in a stable and had plenty of oats and hay to eat, just as any other Ass would. The Lapdog knew many tricks and was a great favorite with his master, who often fondled him and seldom went out to dine without bringing him home some tidbit to eat. The Ass, on the contrary, had much work to do in grinding the corn-mill and in carrying wood from the forest or burdens from the farm. He often lamented his own hard fate and contrasted it with the luxury and idleness of the Lapdog, till at last one day he broke his cords and halter, and galloped into his master&#039;s house, kicking up his heels without measure, and frisking and fawning as well as he could. He next tried to jump about his master as he had seen the Lapdog do, but he broke the table and smashed all the dishes upon it to atoms. He then attempted to lick his master, and jumped upon his back. The servants, hearing the strange hubbub and perceiving the danger of their master, quickly relieved him, and drove out the Ass to his stable with kicks and clubs and cuffs. The Ass, as he returned to his stall beaten nearly to death, thus lamented: &quot;I have brought it all on myself! Why could I not have been contented to labor with my companions, and not wish to be idle all the day like that useless little Lapdog!&quot;

The Ass and the Mule
  A MULETEER set forth on a journey, driving before him an Ass and a Mule, both well laden. The Ass, as long as he traveled along the plain, carried his load with ease, but when he began to ascend the steep path of the mountain, felt his load to be more than he could bear. He entreated his companion to relieve him of a small portion, that he might carry home the rest; but the Mule paid no attention to the request. The Ass shortly afterwards fell down dead under his burden. Not knowing what else to do in so wild a region, the Muleteer placed upon the Mule the load carried by the Ass in addition to his own, and at the top of all placed the hide of the Ass, after he had skinned him. The Mule, groaning beneath his heavy burden, said to himself: &quot;I am treated according to my deserts. If I had only been willing to assist the Ass a little in his need, I should not now be bearing, together with his burden, himself as well.&quot;

The Bat and the Weasels 
  A BAT who fell upon the ground and was caught by a Weasel pleaded to be spared his life. The Weasel refused, saying that he was by nature the enemy of all birds. The Bat assured him that he was not a bird, but a mouse, and thus was set free. Shortly afterwards the Bat again fell to the ground and was caught by another Weasel, whom he likewise entreated not to eat him. The Weasel said that he had a special hostility to mice. The Bat assured him that he was not a mouse, but a bat, and thus a second time escaped.  It is wise to turn circumstances to good account.

The Belly and the Members
  THE MEMBERS of the Body rebelled against the Belly, and said, &quot;Why should we be perpetually engaged in administering to your wants, while you do nothing but take your rest, and enjoy yourself in luxury and self-indulgence?&#039; The Members carried out their resolve and refused their assistance to the Belly. The whole Body quickly became debilitated, and the hands, feet, mouth, and eyes, when too late, repented of their folly.

The Black Monkey and the Turtoise
The Black monkey said to the Tortoise, "Tortoise, come and pay me a visit at my place. Do not fail to keep your promise."<p>The Tortoise accepted the invitation and went at the appointed time. The Black monkey made a great feast in honour of the Tortoise; and the wives of the Black monkey prepared a great deal of food — meat and fish of various kinds, manioca bitter and sweet, greens, pottage, palm oil chop, plantains and yams; all sorts of delicacies.<p>When the Tortoise arrived, the Black monkey greeted him in a friendly way, and shortly afterward said to him, "Tortoise, we are about to commence our feast; seat yourself in this high chair which I have prepared for you." He pointed to a very high chair with steps to reach it. The Tortoise gazed at it, and did not feel happy about it; the chair was so high, and the Tortoise knows nothing about height, he does not know how to climb. However, he tried, and tried, and tried again; but could not do it. Every time he tried, he fell back, and covered himself with dust and earth. At last, he became very angry, and said to his host, "You keep your feast! I am going home. After two nights, you come to my place."<p>The Black monkey waited until the two nights had passed, and then went to the home of the Tortoise. The Tortoise came out to meet him with shouts of welcome, crying, You have come? you have come? My wives, come, and prepare a feast for my friend the Black monkey."<p>At last the preparations were complete, and the feast ready. Then the Tortoise called for a basin of water, which was brought to him. He said,  Black monkey, before you eat of my feast, wash your hands; I will not have you eat with those black hands. I want them to be quite clean and white like the hands of the Otter." <p>The Black monkey agreed; and proceeded to wash his hands. Wash, wash, and wash again; it was useless, his hands were as black as ever.<p>The Tortoise said, You are a dirty person; your hands are black! You certainly shall not eat my food with such black hands as those!  At that the Black monkey flew into a rage; for he knew that his hands would not become white like those of the Otter; his fate had given him black ones, and it was useless to wash them.<p>The Tortoise said, You tricked me; now I have tricked you: we are quits!"<p>They shook hands; one said to the other, "Then you are a man of mature age after all;" and the other said, &#039;&#039;And you are a real man!"<p>After that they held a feast at the Black monkey&#039;s home, the guests sitting in comfort on mats; and another at the home of the Tortoise, when everything went off well; and from that time they were friends.<br>

The Bremen town musicians
There was once an ass whose master had made him carry sacks to the mill for many a long year, but whose strength began at last to fail, so that each day as it came found him less capable of work. Then his master began to think of turning him out, but the ass, guessing that something was in the wind that boded him no good, ran away, taking the road to Bremen; for there he thought he might get an engagement as town musician. When he had gone a little way he found a hound lying by the side of the road panting, as if he had run a long way. "Now, Holdfast, what are you so out of breath about?" said the ass. "Oh dear!" said the dog, "now I am old, I get weaker every day, and can do no good in the hunt, so, as my master was going to have me killed, I have made my escape; but now, how am I to gain a living?" - "I will tell you what," said the ass, "I am going to Bremen to become town musician. You may as well go with me, and take up music too. I can play the lute, and you can beat the drum." And the dog consented, and they walked on together. It was not long before they came to a cat sitting in the road, looking as dismal as three wet days. "Now then, what is the matter with you, old shaver?" said the ass. "I should like to know who would be cheerful when his neck is in danger," answered the cat. "Now that I am old my teeth are getting blunt, and I would rather sit by the oven and purr than run about after mice, and my mistress wanted to drown me; so I took myself off; but good advice is scarce, and I do not know what is to become of me." - "Go with us to Bremen," said the ass, "and become town musician. You understand serenading." The cat thought well of the idea, and went with them accordingly. After that the three travellers passed by a yard, and a cock was perched on the gate crowing with all his might. "Your cries are enough to pierce bone and marrow," said the ass; "what is the matter?" - "I have foretold good weather for Lady-day, so that all the shirts may be washed and dried; and now on Sunday morning company is coming, and the mistress has told the cook that I must be made into soup, and this evening my neck is to be wrung, so that I am crowing with all my might while I can." - "You had much better go with us, Chanticleer," said the ass. "We are going to Bremen. At any rate that will be better than dying. You have a powerful voice, and when we are all performing together it will have a very good effect." So the cock consented, and they went on all four together.<p>But Bremen was too far off to be reached in one day, and towards evening they came to a wood, where they determined to pass the night. The ass and the dog lay down under a large tree; the cat got up among the branches, and the cock flew up to the top, as that was the safest place for him. Before he went to sleep he looked all round him to the four points of the compass, and perceived in the distance a little light shining, and he called out to his companions that there must be a house not far off, as he could see a light, so the ass said, "We had better get up and go there, for these are uncomfortable quarters." The dog began to fancy a few bones, not quite bare, would do him good. And they all set off in the direction of the light, and it grew larger and brighter, until at last it led them to a robber&#039;s house, all lighted up. The ass. being the biggest, went up to the window, and looked in. "Well, what do you see?" asked the dog. "What do I see?" answered the ass; "here is a table set out with splendid eatables and drinkables, and robbers sitting at it and making themselves very comfortable." - "That would just suit us," said the cock. "Yes, indeed, I wish we were there," said the ass. Then they consulted together how it should be managed so as to get the robbers out of the house, and at last they hit on a plan. The ass was to place his forefeet on the window-sill, the dog was to get on the ass&#039;s back, the cat on the top of the dog, and lastly the cock was to fly up and perch on the cat&#039;s head. When that was done, at a given signal they all began to perform their music. The ass brayed, the dog barked, the cat mewed, and the cock crowed; then they burst through into the room, breaking all the panes of glass. The robbers fled at the dreadful sound; they thought it was some goblin, and fled to the wood in the utmost terror. Then the four companions sat down to table, made free with the remains of the meal, and feasted as if they had been hungry for a month.<p>And when they had finished they put out the lights, and each sought out a sleeping-place to suit his nature and habits. The ass laid himself down outside on the dunghill, the dog behind the door, the cat on the hearth by the warm ashes, and the cock settled himself in the cockloft, and as they were all tired with their long journey they soon fell fast asleep. When midnight drew near, and the robbers from afar saw that no light was burning, and that everything appeared quiet, their captain said to them that he thought that they had run away without reason, telling one of them to go and reconnoitre. So one of them went, and found everything quite quiet; he went into the kitchen to strike a light, and taking the glowing fiery eyes of the cat for burning coals, he held a match to them in order to kindle it. But the cat, not seeing the joke, flew into his face, spitting and scratching. Then he cried out in terror, and ran to get out at the back door, but the dog, who was lying there, ran at him and bit his leg; and as he was rushing through the yard by the dunghill the ass struck out and gave him a great kick with his hind foot; and the cock, who had been wakened with the noise, and felt quite brisk, cried out, "Cock-a-doodle-doo!" Then the robber got back as well as he could to his captain, and said, "Oh dear! in that house there is a gruesome witch, and I felt her breath and her long nails in my face; and by the door there stands a man who stabbed me in the leg with a knife; and in the yard there lies a black spectre, who beat me with his wooden club; and above, upon the roof, there sits the justice, who cried, &#039;Bring that rogue here!&#039; And so I ran away from the place as fast as I could." From that time forward the robbers never ventured to that house, and the four Bremen town musicians found themselves so well off where they were, that there they stayed. And the person who last related this tale is still living, as you see.

The Bull, the Tup, the Cock, and the Steg
A bull, a tup, a cock, and a steg set out together to seek their fortune. When it got to night, they came to a house, and asked for a night&#039;s lodging, but the folks said no. However, at last they were let come into the kitchen. The bull said he would lie on the floor, the tup said he would lie by his side, the cock would perch on the rannel bank, and the steg would stand at t&#039; back of the door.<p>At midnight, when all was quiet, two men, meaning to rob the house, were heard parleying outside which should go in, and which watch outside. One went in, the bull got up and knocked him about, the tup did the same, and the cock said, "Fetch him here, I&#039;ll pick out his eyen."<p>So he says, "I&#039;d best be out of this."<p>As he went to the door, the steg took him by the nose with its neb, and beat him with its wings.<p>The other said when he got out, "What have you done?"<p>"Done!" says he, "The devil knocked me about; when he&#039;d done, one of his imps set on. A thin wi&#039; glowering eyen said, &#039;Fetch him here,&#039; etc. and when I got to the door, a blacksmith took me by the snout with his tongs, and flapped me by the lugs with his leather apron."<br>

The Cat and the Fox
The cat and fox, each like a little saint, <br>On pious pilgrimage together went; <br>Two real Tartufes, two Patelins, birds of prey, <br>Soft-footed rogues, who paid or cleared the way, <br>Picking the bones of poultry, stealing cheese, <br>Rivalling each other. They the road to ease, <br>For it was tedious and long, <br>Oft shortened by contentions sharp and strong.<br>Dispute&#039;s a very happy source; <br>Without it restless souls would sleep of course.<p>Our pilgrims with it made each other hoarse, <br>Quarrelled their fill, then dirt on neighbours cast.<p>Reynard said to the cat at last: <br>"Pretender, are you bettor skilled than I, <br>Who could with tricks a hundred cats supply?"<p>"No," said the cat, "I only boast of one, <br>But that&#039;s worth any thousand known."<p>Ready again their quarrel to begin, <br>With "Yes" and "No," through thick and thin, <br>The pack alarmed them, silencing their din.<p>"Friend," cried the cat, "now search your cunning brain, <br>Examine all your tricks, and search again <br>For some sure plan -- mine&#039;s ready, do you see?" <br>He said, and quick sprang up a lofty tree.<p>Sly Reynard played a hundred pranks in vain, <br>Entered a hundred holes -- escaped assault, <br>Put Finder and his brothers in default; <br>He sought asylum all around, <br>But he nowhere asylum found.<p>They watched the burrow where he hid so sly, <br>And smoked him out -- two terriers were nigh, <br>Who worried him as he went bounding by.<p>Avoid too many schemes; there ruin lies; <br>For while we choose, the happy moment flies.<p>Have but one plan, and let that plan be wise.

The City Mouse and the Country Mouse
A Town Mouse once visited a relative who lived in the country. For lunch the Country Mouse served wheat stalks, roots, and acorns, with a dash of cold water for drink. The Town Mouse ate very sparingly, nibbling a little of this and a little of that, and by her manner making it very plain that she ate the simple food only to be polite.<p>After the meal the friends had a long talk, or rather the Town Mouse talked about her life in the city while the Country Mouse listened. They then went to bed in a cozy nest in the hedgerow and slept in quiet and comfort until morning. In her sleep the Country Mouse dreamed she was a Town Mouse with all the luxuries and delights of city life that her friend had described for her. So the next day when the Town Mouse asked the Country Mouse to go home with her to the city, she gladly said yes.<p>When they reached the mansion in which the Town Mouse lived, they found on the table in the dining room the leavings of a very fine banquet. There were sweetmeats and jellies, pastries, delicious cheeses, indeed, the most tempting foods that a Mouse can imagine. But just as the Country Mouse was about to nibble a dainty bit of pastry, she heard a Cat mew loudly and scratch at the door. In great fear the Mice scurried to a hiding place, where they lay quite still for a long time, hardly daring to breathe. When at last they ventured back to the feast, the door opened suddenly and in came the servants to clear the table, followed by the House Dog.<p>The Country Mouse stopped in the Town Mouse&#039;s den only long enough to pick up her carpet bag and umbrella.<p>"You may have luxuries and dainties that I have not," she said as she hurried away, "but I prefer my plain food and simple life in the country with the peace and security that go with it."<p>Poverty with security is better than plenty in the midst of fear and uncertainty.

The Cock and Hen That Went to the Dovrefell
ONCE on a time there was a hen that had flown up, and perched on an oak-tree for the night. When the night came, she dreamed that unless she got to the Dovrefell, the world would come to an end. So that very minute, she jumped down, and set out on her way. When she had walked a bit she met a Cock.<p>"Good day, Cocky-Locky," said the Hen.<p>"Good day, Henny-Penny," said the Cock; "whither away so early?"<p>"Oh, I&#039;m going to the Dovrefell, that the world mayn&#039;t come to an end," said the Hen.<p>"Who told you that, Henny-Penny?" asked the Cock.<p>"I sat in the oak and dreamt it last night," said the Hen.<p>"I&#039;ll go with you," said the Cock.<p>Well, they walked on a good bit, and then they met a Duck.<p>"Good day, Ducky-Lucky," said the Cock.<p>"Good day, Cocky-Locky," said the Duck; "whither away so early?"<p>"Oh, I&#039;m going to the Dovrefell, that the world mayn&#039;t come to an end," said the Cock.<p>"Who told you that, Cocky-Locky?"<p>"Henny-Penny," said the Cock.<p>"Who told you that, Henny-Penny?" asked the Duck.<p>"I sat in the oak and dreamt it last night," said the Hen.<p>"I&#039;ll go with you", said the Duck.<p>So they went off together, and after a bit they met a Goose.<p>"Good day, Goosey-Poosey," said the Duck.<p>"Good day, Ducky-Lucky," said the Goose; "whither away so early?"<p>"I&#039;m going to the Dovrefell, that the world mayn&#039;t come to an end," said the Duck.<p>"Who told you that, Ducky-Lucky?" asked the Goose.<p>"Cocky-Locky."<p>"Who told you that, Cocky-Locky?"<p>"Henny-Penny."<p>"How do you know that, Henny-Penny?" said the Goose.<p>"I sat in the oak and dreamt it last night Goosey-Poosey," said the Hen.<p>"I&#039;ll go with you," said the Goose.<p>Now when they had all walked along for a bit, a Fox met them.<p>"Good day, Foxy-Cocksy," said the Goose.<p>"Good day, Goosey-Poosey."<p>"Whither away, Foxy-Cocksy?"<p>"Whither away yourself, Goosey-Poosey?"<p>"I&#039;m going to the Dovrefell, that the world mayn&#039;t come to an end," said the Goose.<p>"Who told you that, Goosey-Poosey?" asked the Fox.<p>"Ducky-Lucky."<p>"Who told you that, Ducky-Lucky?"<p>"Cocky-Locky."<p>"Who told you that, Cocky-Locky?"<p>"Henny-Penny."<p>"How do you know that, Henny-Penny?"<p>"I sat in the oak and dreamt last night, that if we don&#039;t get to the Dovrefell, the world will come to an end," said the Hen.<p>"Stuff and nonsense," said the Fox; "the world won&#039;t come to an end if you don&#039;t go thither. No; come home with me to my earth. That&#039;s far better. For it&#039;s warm and jolly there."<p>Well, they went home with the Fox to his earth, and when they got in, the Fox laid on lots of fuel, so that they all got very sleepy.<p>The Duck and the Goose, they settled themselves down in a corner, but the Cock and Hen flew up on a post. So when the Goose and Duck were well asleep, the Fox took the Goose and laid him on the embers, and roasted him. The Hen smelt the strong roast-meat, and sprang up to a higher peg, and said, half asleep—<p>"Faugh, what a nasty smell!<br>What a nasty smell!"<p>"Oh, stuff," said the Fox; "it&#039;s only the smoke driven down the chimney; go to sleep again, and hold your tongue."<p>So the Hen went off to sleep again.<p>Now the Fox had hardly got the Goose well down his throat, before he did the very same with the Duck. He took and laid him on the embers, and roasted him for a dainty bit.<p>Then the Hen woke up again, and sprang up to a higher peg still.<p>"Faugh, what a nasty smell!<br>What a nasty smell!"<p>she said again, and then she got her eyes open, and came to see how the Fox had eaten both the twain, Goose and Duck; so she flew up to the highest peg of all, and perched there, and peeped up through the chimney.<p>"Nay, nay; just see what a lovely lot of geese flying yonder," she said to the Fox.<p>Out ran Reynard to fetch a fat roast. But while he was gone, the Hen woke up the Cock, and told him how it had gone with Goosey-Poosey and Ducky-Lucky; and so Cocky-Locky and Henny-Penny flew out through the chimney, and if they hadn&#039;t got to the Dovrefell, it surely would have been all over with the world.<br>

The Cock, the Cuckoo, and the Blackcock
Once on a time the Cock, the Cuckoo, and the Blackcock bought a cow between them. But when they came to share it, and could not agree which should buy the others out, they settled that he who woke first in the morning should have the cow.<p>So the Cock woke first.<p>"Now the cow&#039;s mine!<br>Now the cow&#039;s mine!<br>Hurrah! hurrah!"<p>he crew, and as he crew, up awoke the Cuckoo.<p>"Half cow! <br>Half cow!"<p>sang the Cuckoo, and woke up the Blackcock.<p>"A like share, a like share;<br>Dear friends, that&#039;s only fair!<br>Saw see! See saw!"<p>That&#039;s what the Blackcock said.<p>And now, can you tell me which of them ought to have the cow?<br>

The Crow and the Fox
Master Crow perched on a tree,<br>Was holding a cheese in his beak.<br>Master Fox attracted by the smell<br>Said something like this:<br>"Well, Hello Mister Crow!<br>How beautiful you are! how nice you seem to me!<br>Really, if your voice<br>Is like your plumage,<br>You are the phoenix of all the inhabitants of these woods."<br>At these words, the Crow is overjoyed.<br>And in order to show off his beautiful voice,<br>He opens his beak wide, lets his prey fall<br>The Fox grabs it, and says: "My good man,<br>Learn that every flatterer<br>Lives at the expense of the one who listens to him.<br>This lesson, without doubt, is well worth a cheese."<br>The Crow, ashamed and embarrassed,<br>Swore, but a little late, that he would not be taken again. 

The Dog and the Cheese
It happened long ago, they say:<br>A dog, crossing a bridge one day,<br>Was clasping with his teeth some cheese.<br>Half way across the bridge, he sees<br>His cheese&#039;s shadow in the stream.<br>Deep in his heart he has this dream:<br>He&#039;d like that second morsel, too.<br>Now there&#039;s a greedy dog for you!<br>He jumps right in, opens-his mouth,<br>And as he does, the cheese falls out!<br>Shadow it is, shadow he sees, <br>And that is how he lost his cheese.<p><p>So therefore people should take heed<br>Who are misguided by their greed.<br>Those who desire more than is just<br>Will be undone by their own lust.<br>They&#039;ll lose whatever they had before,<br>And get from others nothing more. 

The Dog and the Shadow
  A DOG, crossing a bridge over a stream with a piece of flesh in his mouth, saw his own shadow in the water and took it for that of another Dog, with a piece of meat double his own in size. He immediately let go of his own, and fiercely attacked the other Dog to get his larger piece from him. He thus lost both: that which he grasped at in the water, because it was a shadow; and his own, because the stream swept it away.

The Dog and the Sparrow
A shepherd&#039;s dog had a master who took no care of him, but often let him suffer the greatest hunger. At last he could bear it no longer; so he took to his heels, and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood. On the road he met a sparrow that said to him, "Why are you so sad, my friend?" - "Because," said the dog, "I am very very hungry, and have nothing to eat." - "If that be all," answered the sparrow, "come with me into the next town, and I will soon find you plenty of food." So on they went together into the town: and as they passed by a butcher&#039;s shop, the sparrow said to the dog, "Stand there a little while till I peck you down a piece of meat." So the sparrow perched upon the shelf: and having first looked carefully about her to see if anyone was watching her, she pecked and scratched at a steak that lay upon the edge of the shelf, till at last down it fell. Then the dog snapped it up, and scrambled away with it into a corner, where he soon ate it all up. "Well," said the sparrow, "you shall have some more if you will; so come with me to the next shop, and I will peck you down another steak." When the dog had eaten this too, the sparrow said to him, "Well, my good friend, have you had enough now?" - "I have had plenty of meat," answered he, "but I should like to have a piece of bread to eat after it." - "Come with me then," said the sparrow, "and you shall soon have that too." So she took him to a baker&#039;s shop, and pecked at two rolls that lay in the window, till they fell down: and as the dog still wished for more, she took him to another shop and pecked down some more for him. When that was eaten, the sparrow asked him whether he had had enough now. "Yes," said he; "and now let us take a walk a little way out of the town."<p>So they both went out upon the high road; but as the weather was warm, they had not gone far before the dog said, "I am very much tired, I should like to take a nap." - "Very well," answered the sparrow, "do so, and in the meantime I will perch upon that bush." So the dog stretched himself out on the road, and fell fast asleep. Whilst he slept, there came by a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine. The sparrow, seeing that the carter did not turn out of the way, but would go on in the track in which the dog lay, so as to drive over him, called out, "Stop! Stop! Mr Carter, or it shall be the worse for you." But the carter, grumbling to himself, "You make it the worse for me, indeed! What can you do?" cracked his whip, and drove his cart over the poor dog, so that the wheels crushed him to death. "There," cried the sparrow, "thou cruel villain, thou hast killed my friend the dog. Now mind what I say. This deed of thine shall cost thee all thou art worth." - "Do your worst, and welcome," said the brute, "what harm can you do me?" and passed on. But the sparrow crept under the tilt of the cart, and pecked at the bung of one of the casks till she loosened it; and than all the wine ran out, without the carter seeing it. At last he looked round, and saw that the cart was dripping, and the cask quite empty. "What an unlucky wretch I am!" cried he. "Not wretch enough yet!" said the sparrow, as she alighted upon the head of one of the horses, and pecked at him till he reared up and kicked. When the carter saw this, he drew out his hatchet and aimed a blow at the sparrow, meaning to kill her; but she flew away, and the blow fell upon the poor horse&#039;s head with such force, that he fell down dead. "Unlucky wretch that I am!" cried he. "Not wretch enough yet!" said the sparrow. And as the carter went on with the other two horses, she again crept under the tilt of the cart, and pecked out the bung of the second cask, so that all the wine ran out. When the carter saw this, he again cried out, "Miserable wretch that I am!" But the sparrow answered, "Not wretch enough yet!" and perched on the head of the second horse, and pecked at him too. The carter ran up and struck at her again with his hatchet; but away she flew, and the blow fell upon the second horse and killed him on the spot. "Unlucky wretch that I am!" said he. "Not wretch enough yet!" said the sparrow; and perching upon the third horse, she began to peck him too. The carter was mad with fury; and without looking about him, or caring what he was about, struck again at the sparrow; but killed his third horse as he done the other two. "Alas! miserable wretch that I am!" cried he. "Not wretch enough yet!" answered the sparrow as she flew away; "now will I plague and punish thee at thy own house."<p>The carter was forced at last to leave his cart behind him, and to go home overflowing with rage and vexation. "Alas!" said he to his wife, "what ill luck has befallen me! my wine is all spilt, and my horses all three dead." - "Alas! husband," replied she, "and a wicked bird has come into the house, and has brought with her all the birds in the world, I am sure, and they have fallen upon our corn in the loft, and are eating it up at such a rate!" Away ran the husband upstairs, and saw thousands of birds sitting upon the floor eating up his corn, with the sparrow in the midst of them. "Unlucky wretch that I am!" cried the carter; for he saw that the corn was almost all gone. "Not wretch enough yet!" said the sparrow; "thy cruelty shall cost thee they life yet!" and away she flew.<p>The carter seeing that he had thus lost all that he had, went down into his kitchen; and was still not sorry for what he had done, but sat himself angrily and sulkily in the chimney corner. But the sparrow sat on the outside of the window, and cried "Carter! Thy cruelty shall cost thee thy life!" With that he jumped up in a rage, seized his hatchet, and threw it at the sparrow; but it missed her, and only broke the window. The sparrow now hopped in, perched upon the window- seat, and cried, "Carter! It shall cost thee thy life!" Then he became mad and blind with rage, and struck the window-seat with such force that he cleft it in two: and as the sparrow flew from place to place, the carter and his wife were so furious, that they broke all their furniture, glasses, chairs, benches, the table, and at last the walls, without touching the bird at all. In the end, however, they caught her: and the wife said, "Shall I kill her at once?" - "No," cried he, "that is letting her off too easily: she shall die a much more cruel death; I will eat her." But the sparrow began to flutter about, and stretch out her neck and cried, "Carter! it shall cost thee thy life yet!" With that he could wait no longer: so he gave his wife the hatchet, and cried, "Wife, strike at the bird and kill her in my hand." And the wife struck; but she missed her aim, and hit her husband on the head so that he fell down dead, and the sparrow flew quietly home to her nest.

The Dog and the Wolf
I will, as briefly as I may,<br>The sweets of liberty display.<br>A Wolf half famish&#039;d, chanced to see<br>A Dog, as fat as dog could be:<br>For one day meeting on the road,<br>They mutual compliments bestowed:<br>&quot; Prithee,&quot; says Isgrim, faint and weak,<br>&quot;How came you so well fed and sleek ?<br>I starve, though stronger of the two.&quot;<br>&quot; It will be just as well with you,&quot;<br>The Dog quite cool and frank replied,<br>&quot;If with my master you&#039;ll abide.&quot;<br>&quot;For what ?&quot; &quot;Why merely to attend,<br>And from night thieves the door defend.&quot;<br>&quot; I gladly will accept the post,<br>What! shall I bear with snow and frost<br>And all this rough inclement plight,<br>Rather than have a home at night,<br>And feed on plenty at my ease ?&quot;<br>&quot; Come, then, with me &quot;-the Wolf agrees.<br>But as they went the mark he found,<br>Where the Dog&#039;s collar had been bound:<br>&quot;What&#039;s this, my friend ?&quot; &quot;Why, nothing.&quot; &quot;Nay,<br>Be more explicit, sir, I pray.&quot;<br>&quot; I&#039;m somewhat fierce and apt to bite,<br>Therefore they hold me pretty tight,<br>That in the day-time I may sleep,<br>And night by night my vigils keep.<br>At eveningtide they let me out,<br>And then I freely walk about:<br>Bread comes without a care of mine.<br>I from my master&#039;s table dine;<br>The servants throw me many a scrap,<br>With choice of pot-liquor to lap;<br>So, I&#039;ve my bellyful, you find.&quot;<br>&quot;But can you go where you&#039;ve a mind?&quot;<br>&quot;Not always, to be flat and plain.&quot;<br>&quot;Then, Dog, enjoy your post again,<br>For to remain this servile thing,<br>Old Isgrim would not be a king.&quot; 

The Dog in the River
The churl that wants another&#039;s fare<br>Deserves at least to lose his share.<br>As through the stream a Dog convey&#039;d<br>A piece of meat, he spied his shade<br>In the clear mirror of the flood,<br>And thinking it was flesh and blood,<br>Snapp&#039;d to deprive him of the treat:-<br>But mark the glutton&#039;s self-defeat,<br>Miss&#039;d both another&#039;s and his own,<br>Both shade and substance, beef and bone. 

The duration of life
When God had created the world and was about to fix the length of each creature&#039;s life, the ass came and asked, "Lord, how long shall I live?" - "Thirty years," replied God; "does that content thee?" - "Ah, Lord," answered the ass, "that is a long time. Think of my painful existence! To carry heavy burdens from morning to night, to drag sacks of corn to the mill, that others may eat bread, to be cheered and refreshed with nothing but blows and kicks. Relieve me of a portion of this long time." Then God had pity on him and relieved him of eighteen years. The ass went away comforted, and the dog appeared. "How long wouldst thou like to live?" said God to him. "Thirty years are too many for the ass, but thou wilt be satisfied with that." - "Lord," answered the dog, "is that thy will? Consider how I shall have to run, my feet will never hold out so long, and when I have once lost my voice for barking, and my teeth for biting, what will be left for me to do but run from one corner to another and growl?" God saw that he was right, and released him from twelve years of life. Then came the monkey. "Thou wilt certainly live thirty years willingly?" said the Lord to him. "Thou hast no need to work as the ass and the dog have to do, and wilt always enjoy thyself." - "Ah! Lord," he answered, "it may seem as if that were the case, but it is quite different. When it rains porridge I have no spoon. I am always to play merry pranks, and make faces which force people to laugh, and if they give me an apple, and I bite into it, why it is sour! How often sadness hides itself behind mirth! I shall never be able to hold out for thirty years." God was gracious and took off ten.<p>At last man appeared, joyous, healthy and vigorous, and begged God to appoint his time for him. "Thirty years shalt thou live," said the Lord. "Is that enough for thee?" - "What a short time," cried man, "when I have built my house and my fire burns on my own hearth; when I have planted trees which blossom and bear fruit, and am just intending to enjoy my life, I am to die! O Lord, lengthen my time." - "I will add to it the ass&#039;s eighteen years," said God. "That is not enough," replied the man. "Thou shalt also have the dog&#039;s twelve years." - "Still too little!" - "Well, then," said God, "I will give thee the monkey&#039;s ten years also, but more thou shalt not have." The man went away, but was not satisfied.<p>So man lives seventy years. The first thirty are his human years, which are soon gone; then is he healthy, merry, works with pleasure, and is glad of his life. Then follow the ass&#039;s eighteen years, when one burden after another is laid on him, he has to carry the corn which feeds others, and blows and kicks are the reward of his faithful services. Then come the dog&#039;s twelve years, when he lies in the corner, and growls and has no longer any teeth to bite with, and when this time is over the monkey&#039;s ten years form the end. Then man is weak- headed and foolish, does silly things, and becomes the jest of the children.

The Farmer and the Stork
  A FARMER placed nets on his newly-sown plowlands and caught a number of Cranes, which came to pick up his seed. With them he trapped a Stork that had fractured his leg in the net and was earnestly beseeching the Farmer to spare his life. &quot;Pray save me, Master,&quot; he said, &quot;and let me go free this once. My broken limb should excite your pity. Besides, I am no Crane, I am a Stork, a bird of excellent character; and see how I love and slave for my father and mother. Look too, at my feathers-- they are not the least like those of a Crane.&quot; The Farmer  laughed aloud and said, &quot;It may be all as you say, I only know  this: I have taken you with these robbers, the Cranes, and you  must die in their company.&quot;  Birds of a feather flock together.

The Fisherman and His Nets
  A FISHERMAN, engaged in his calling, made a very successful cast and captured a great haul of fish. He managed by a skillful handling of his net to retain all the large fish and to draw them to the shore; but he could not prevent the smaller fish from falling back through the meshes of the net into the sea.

The fox and the cat
It happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to herself, "He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the world," she spoke to him in a friendly way. "Good-day, dear Mr. Fox, how are you? How is all with you? How are you getting through this dear season?" The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the cat from head to foot, and for a long time did not know whether he would give any answer or not. At last he said, "Oh, thou wretched beard-cleaner, thou piebald fool, thou hungry mouse-hunter, what canst thou be thinking of? Dost thou venture to ask how I am getting on? What hast thou learnt? How many arts dost thou understand?" - "I understand but one," replied the cat, modestly. "What art is that?" asked the fox. "When the hounds are following me, I can spring into a tree and save myself." - "Is that all?" said the fox. "I am master of a hundred arts, and have into the bargain a sackful of cunning. Thou makest me sorry for thee; come with me, I will teach thee how people get away from the hounds." Just then came a hunter with four dogs. The cat sprang nimbly up a tree, and sat down on top of it, where the branches and foliage quite concealed her. "Open your sack, Mr. Fox, open your sack," cried the cat to him, but the dogs had already seized him, and were holding him fast. "Ah, Mr. Fox," cried the cat. "You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch! Had you been able to climb like me, you would not have lost your life."

The Fox and the Crane
A fox and a crane became friends. The fox wanted to give her friend the crane a treat and invited him to dinner.<br>"Come and have dinner with me, Brother Crane, I&#039;ll give you an excellent meal!"<br>The crane accepted the invitation and the fox made some porridge and spread it on plates.<br>"Eat it all up, Brother Crane," said the fox, "it&#039;s very good, I made it myself."<br>The crane pecked and pecked at the plate with his long beak; he pecked and pecked but could not get anything off the plate.<br>Meanwhile the fox was licking her plate with her tongue; she licked and licked until the plate was quite clean. She ate up all the porridge herself.<br>"Don&#039;t be angry with me, Brother Crane, but that&#039;s all I have in the house. There&#039;s nothing else to eat."<br>"Thank you for that, Sister Fox," answered the crane. "Now you must come and have dinner with me one day."<br>The fox went to the crane for dinner. The crane had made some soup and put it in tall jars with narrow necks. He put the jars on the table and said:<br>"Eat it all up, Sister Fox. It&#039;s all I have in the house."<br>The fox walked round and round her jar. She tried this way and that, she licked it, she sniffed it, but not a drop of that soup could she get, for her head was too big to go into the neck of the jar.<br>But the crane had his long beak in the jar and pecked and pecked until he had eaten all the soup.<br>"Don&#039;t be angry with me, Sister Fox, but that&#039;s really all I have in the house."<br>But the fox was angry. She had thought she would eat enough to last her a week, but she went home hungry, as hungry as she had come. The crane had given her tit for tat.<br>Since then there has been no friendship between the fox and the crane.

The Fox and the Crow
A crow, holding in his mouth a piece of cheese, stood perched aloft. A crafty fox who hankered for the cheese deceived the bird with words to this effect: "Sir Crow thy wings are beautiful, bright and keen thine eye, thy neck a wonder to behold. An eagle&#039;s breast thou dost display, and with thy talons over all the beasts thou canst prevail. So great a bird thou art; yet mute, alas, and without utterance." On hearing this flattery the crow&#039;s heart was puffed up with conceit, and, dropping the cheese from his mouth, he loudly screamed: "Caw! Caw!" The clever fox pounced on the cheese and tauntingly remarked: "You were not dumb, it seems, you have indeed a voice; you have everything, Sir Crow, except brains."

The Fox and the Crow
A crow was sitting on a branch of a tree with a piece of cheese in her beak when a fox observed her and set his wits to work to discover some way of getting the cheese. Coming and standing under the tree he looked up and said, "What a noble bird I see above me! Her beauty is without equal, the hue of her plumage exquisite. If only her voice is as sweet as her looks are fair, she ought without doubt to be queen of the birds." The crow was hugely flattered by this, and just to show the fox that she could sing she gave a loud caw. Down came the cheese, of course, and the fox, snatching it up, said, "You have a voice, madam, I see. What you want is wits."

The Fox and the Crow
His folly in repentance ends,<br>Who, to a flatt&#039;ring knave attends.<br>A Crow, her hanger to appease,<br>Had from a window stolen some cheese,<br>And sitting on a lofty pine<br>In state, was just about to dine.<br>This, when a Fox observed below,<br>He thus harangued the foolish Crow:<br>&quot; Lady, how beauteous to the view<br>Those glossy plumes of sable hue!<br>Thy features how divinely fair!<br>With what a shape, and what an air!<br>Could you but frame your voice to sing,<br>You&#039;d have no rival on the wing.&#039;<br>But she, now willing to display<br>Her talents in the vocal way,<br>Let go the cheese of luscious taste,<br>Which Renard seized with greedy haste.<br>The grudging dupe now sees at last<br>That for her folly she must fast. 

The fox and the crow
Master Reynard the fox once saw a crow fly off with a piece of cheese in its beak and settle on a branch of a tree.<p>"That’s for me, as I am a fox," said Master Reynard, and he walked up to the foot of the tree.<p>“Good day, Mistress Crow,” he cried. “How well you are looking today: your feathers are so glossy; your eyes are so bright. I feel sure your voice must be more beautiful than that of other birds. Let me hear just one song from you, so that I may call you the Queen of Birds.”<p>The crow, who really couldn’t sing very well, lifted up her head and began to caw her best, but the moment she opened her mouth the piece of cheese fell to the ground. Master Reynard snapped it up at once.<p>“That will do,” said he. “That was all I wanted.”<p>He looked up at the crow, and said: “In exchange for your cheese I will give you a piece of advice for the future: ‘Do not trust flatterers.’”

The Fox and the Grapes
A FAMISHED FOX saw some clusters of ripe black grapes hanging<br>from a trellised vine. She resorted to all her tricks to get at<br>them, but wearied herself in vain, for she could not reach them. <br>At last she turned away, hiding her disappointment and saying:<br>"The Grapes are sour, and not ripe as I thought."

The Fox and the Grapes
An hungry Fox with fierce attack<br>Sprang on a Vine, but tumbled back,<br>Nor could attain the point in view,<br>So near the sky the bunches grew.<br>As he went off, &quot;They&#039;re scurvy stuff,&quot;<br>Says he, &quot;and not half ripe enough--<br>And I &#039;ve more rev&#039;rence for my tripes<br>Than to torment them with the gripes.&quot;<br>For those this tale is very pat<br>Who lessen what they can&#039;t come at. 

The Fox and the Stork
One should do injury to none;<br>But he that has th&#039; assault begun,<br>Ought, says the fabulist, to find<br>The dread of being served in kind,<br>A Fox, to sup within his cave<br>The Stork an invitation gave,<br>Where, in a shallow dish, was pour&#039;d<br>Some broth, which he himself devoured;<br>While the poor hungry Stork was fain<br>Inevitably to abstain.<br>The Stork, in turn, the Fox invites,<br>And brings her liver and her lights<br>In a tall flagon, finely minced,<br>And thrusting in her beak, convinced<br>The Fox that he in grief must fast,<br>While she enjoy&#039;d the rich repast.<br>Then, as in vain he lick&#039;d the neck,<br>The Stork was heard her guest to check, -<br>&#039; That every one the fruits should bear<br>Of their example, is but fair." 

The Fox and the Woodcutter
  A FOX, running before the hounds, came across a Woodcutter felling an oak and begged him to show him a safe hiding-place.  The Woodcutter advised him to take shelter in his own hut, so the Fox crept in and hid himself in a corner. The huntsman soon came up with his hounds and inquired of the Woodcutter if he had seen the Fox. He declared that he had not seen him, and yet pointed, all the time he was speaking, to the hut where the Fox lay hidden. The huntsman took no notice of the signs, but believing his word, hastened forward in the chase. As soon as they were well away, the Fox departed without taking any notice of the Woodcutter: whereon he called to him and reproached him, saying, &quot;You ungrateful fellow, you owe your life to me, and yet you leave me without a word of thanks.&quot; The Fox replied, &quot;Indeed, I should have thanked you fervently if your deeds had been as good as your words, and if your hands had not been traitors to your speech.&quot;

The Fox as Herdsman
ONCE on a time there was a woman who went out to hire a herdsman, and she met a bear.<p>"Whither away, Goody?" said Bruin.<p>"Oh, I&#039;m going out to hire a herdsman," answered the woman.<p>"Why not have me for a herdsman?" said Bruin.<p>"Well, why not?" said the woman. "If you only knew how to call the flock; just let me hear."<p>"OW, OW!" growled the bear.<p>"No, no! I won&#039;t have you," said the woman, as soon as she heard him say that, and off she went on her way.<p>So, when she had gone a bit farther, she met a wolf.<p>"Whither away, Goody?" asked the Wolf.<p>"Oh," said she, "I&#039;m going out to hire a herdsman."<p>"Why not have me for a herdsman?" said the Wolf.<p>"Well, why not? if you can only call the flock; let me hear," said she.<p>"Uh, uh!" said the Wolf.<p>"No, no!" said the woman; "you&#039;ll never do for me."<p>Well, after she had gone a while longer, she met a fox.<p>"Whither away, Goody?" asked the Fox.<p>"Oh, I&#039;m just going out to hire a herdsman," said the woman.<p>"Why not have me for your herdsman?" asked the Fox.<p>"Well, why not?" said she; "if you only knew how to call the flock; let me hear."<p>"Dil-dal-holom," sung out the Fox, in such a fine clear voice.<p>"Yes; I&#039;ll have you for my herdsman," said the woman; and so she set the Fox to herd her flock.<p>The first day the Fox was herdsman he ate up all the woman&#039;s goats; the next day he made an end of all her sheep; and the third day he ate up all her kine. So, when he came home at even, the woman asked what he had done with all her flocks?<p>"Oh!" said the Fox, "their skulls are in the stream, and their bodies in the holt."<p>Now, the Goody stood and churned when the Fox said this, but she thought she might as well step out and see after her flock; and while she was away the Fox crept into the churn and ate up the cream. So when the Goody came back and saw that, she fell into such a rage, that she snatched up the little morsel of the cream that was left, and threw it at the Fox as he ran off, so that he got a dab of it on the end of his tail, and that&#039;s the reason why the fox has a white tip to his brush.<br>

The Fox Who Had Lost His Tail
  A FOX caught in a trap escaped, but in so doing lost his tail.  Thereafter, feeling his life a burden from the shame and ridicule to which he was exposed, he schemed to convince all the other Foxes that being tailless was much more attractive, thus making up for his own deprivation. He assembled a good many Foxes and publicly advised them to cut off their tails, saying that they would not only look much better without them, but that they would get rid of the weight of the brush, which was a very great inconvenience. One of them interrupting him said, &quot;If you had not yourself lost your tail, my friend, you would not thus counsel us.&quot;

The Frog and the Rat
Merlin said well, that those who often cheat<br>Will sometimes cheat themselves -- the phrase is old.<br>I&#039;m sorry that it is, I must repeat,<br>It&#039;s full of energy, and sound as gold.<p>But to my story: Once a well fed rat,<br>Rotund and wealthy, plump and fat,<br>Not knowing either Fast or Lent,<br>Lounging beside a marsh pool went.<p>A frog addressed him in the frog&#039;s own tongue,<br>And asked him home to dinner civilly.<br>No need to make the invitation long.<br>He spoke, however, of the things he&#039;d see:<br>The pleasant bath, worth curiosity;<br>The novelties along the marsh&#039;s shore,<br>The score and score<br>Of spots of beauty, manners of the races,<br>The government of various places,<br>Some day he would recount with glee<br>Unto his youthful progeny.<p>One thing alone the gallant vexed,<br>And his adventurous soul perplexed;<br>He swam but little, and he needed aid.<p>The friendly frog was undismayed;<br>His paw to hers she strongly tied,<br>And then they started side by side.<p>The hostess towed her frightened guest<br>Quick to the bottom of the lake --<br>Perfidious breach of law of nations --<br>All promises she faithless breaks,<br>And sinks her friend to make fresh rations.<br>Already did her appetite<br>Dwell on the morsel with delight,<br>Lunch,<br>Scrunch!<p>He prays the gods; she mocks his woe;<br>He struggles up; she pulls below.<p>And while this combat is fought out,<br>A kite that&#039;s seeking all about<br>Sees the poor rat that&#039;s like to drown;<br>And pounces swift as lightning down.<p>The frog tied to him, by the way,<br>Also became the glad kite&#039;s prey;<br>They gave him all that he could wish,<br>A supper both of meat and fish.<p>So oftentimes a base deceit<br>Falls back upon the father cheat;<br>So oftentimes doth perfidy<br>Return with triple usury.

The Grasshopper and the Ant
The gay grasshopper, full of song<br>All the sunny season long,<br>Was unprovided and brought low,<br>When the north wind began to blow ; <br>Had not a scrap of worm or fly,<br>Hunger and want began to cry ; <br>Never was creature more perplexed.<br>She called upon her neighbour ant,<br>And humbly prayed her just to grant <br>Some grain till August next ;<br>“I&#039;ll pay, ” she said, “what ye invest, <br>Both principal and interest,<br>Honour of insects –and that&#039;s tender. ”<br>The ant, however, is no lender ;<br>That is her least defective side ;<br>“But, hark ye, pray, Miss Borrower, ” she cried, <br>“What were ye doing in fine weather ? ” <br>“ Singing . . .  nay,! look not thus askance,<br>To every comer day and night together. ”<br>“ Singing ! I&#039;m glad of that ; why now then dance. ”

The Hares and the Frogs
  THE HARES, oppressed by their own exceeding timidity and weary of the perpetual alarm to which they were exposed, with one accord determined to put an end to themselves and their troubles by jumping from a lofty precipice into a deep lake below. As they scampered off in large numbers to carry out their resolve, the Frogs lying on the banks of the lake heard the noise of their feet and rushed helter-skelter to the deep water for safety. On seeing the rapid disappearance of the Frogs, one of the Hares cried out to his companions: &quot;Stay, my friends, do not do as you intended; for you now see that there are creatures who are still more timid than ourselves.&quot;

The Jackdaw and the Fox
  A HALF-FAMISHED JACKDAW seated himself on a fig-tree, which had produced some fruit entirely out of season, and waited in the hope that the figs would ripen. A Fox seeing him sitting so long and learning the reason of his doing so, said to him, &quot;You are indeed, sir, sadly deceiving yourself; you are indulging a hope strong enough to cheat you, but which will never reward you with enjoyment.&quot;

The Kid and the Wolf
  A KID, returning without protection from the pasture, was pursued by a Wolf. Seeing he could not escape, he turned round, and said: &quot;I know, friend Wolf, that I must be your prey, but before I die I would ask of you one favor you will play me a tune to which I may dance.&quot; The Wolf complied, and while he was piping and the Kid was dancing, some hounds hearing the sound ran up and began chasing the Wolf. Turning to the Kid, he said, &quot;It is just what I deserve; for I, who am only a butcher, should not have turned piper to please you.&quot;

The Lion and the Mouse
  A LION was awakened from sleep by a Mouse running over his face.  Rising up angrily, he caught him and was about to kill him, when the Mouse piteously entreated, saying: &quot;If you would only spare my life, I would be sure to repay your kindness.&quot; The Lion laughed and let him go. It happened shortly after this that the Lion was caught by some hunters, who bound him by st ropes to the ground. The Mouse, recognizing his roar, came gnawed the rope with his teeth, and set him free, exclaim  &quot;You ridiculed the idea of my ever being able to help you, expecting to receive from me any repayment of your favor; I now you know that it is possible for even a Mouse to con benefits on a Lion.&quot;

The Lion and the Mouse
Once upon a time there was a little mouse who, coming out of his hole, met an enormous lion.<p>The lion wanted to eat him up.<br>“Please, Mr. Lion, don’t eat me. One day you might need me.”<br>The lion answered, “Why should I need someone as small as you?”<p>Seeing how tiny the mouse was, the lion took pity on him and set him free.<br>One day, the mouse heard an almight roar.<br>It was the lion.<p>When he got to the place, he found the lion trapped in a net.<br>“I’ll save you!” said the mouse.<br>“You?” You are too small for such a hard task.”<p>The mouse started to nibble at the rope of the net and the lion was saved.<p>From that day on they were friends forever.

The Lion and the Mouse
A Lion asleep in his lair was awoken by a Mouse running over his face. Losing his temper he seized it with his paw and was about to kill it. The Mouse, terrified, piteously begged him to spare its life. "Please let me go," it cried, "and one day I will repay you for your kindness." The idea of so insignificant a creature ever being able to do anything for him amused the Lion so much that he laughed aloud, and good-humouredly let it go. But the Mouse&#039;s chance came, after all. One day the Lion got entangled in a net which had been spread for game by some hunters, and the Mouse heard and recognized his roars of anger and ran to the spot. Without more ado it set to work to gnaw the ropes with its teeth, and succeeded before long in setting the Lion free. "There!" said the Mouse, "you laughed at me when I promised I would repay you: but now you see, even a Mouse can help a Lion."<br>

The Lion, the Fox, and the Ass
  THE LION, the Fox and the Ass entered into an agreement to assist each other in the chase. Having secured a large booty, the Lion on their return from the forest asked the Ass to allot his due portion to each of the three partners in the treaty. The Ass carefully divided the spoil into three equal shares and modestly requested the two others to make the first choice. The Lion, bursting out into a great rage, devoured the Ass. Then he requested the Fox to do him the favor to make a division. The Fox accumulated all that they had killed into one large heap and left to himself the smallest possible morsel. The Lion said, &quot;Who has taught you, my very excellent fellow, the art of division? You are perfect to a fraction.&quot; He replied, &quot;I learned it from the Ass, by witnessing his fate.&quot;  Happy is the man who learns from the misfortunes of others.

The Lion, the Wolf, and the Fox
  A LION, growing old, lay sick in his cave. All the beasts came to visit their king, except the Fox. The Wolf therefore, thinking that he had a capital opportunity, accused the Fox to the Lion of not paying any respect to him who had the rule over them all and of not coming to visit him. At that very moment the Fox came in and heard these last words of the Wolf. The Lion roaring out in a rage against him, the Fox sought an opportunity to defend himself and said, &quot;And who of all those who have come to you have benefited you so much as I, who have traveled from place to place in every direction, and have sought and learnt from the physicians the means of healing you?&#039; The Lion commanded him immediately to tell him the cure, when he replied, &quot;You must flay a wolf alive and wrap his skin yet warm around you.&quot; The Wolf was at once taken and flayed; whereon the Fox, turning to him, said with a smile, &quot;You should have moved your master not to ill, but to good, will.&quot;

The Lion, Wolf, and Fox
A feeble lion, gouty, given o&#039;er, <br>Desired some remedy for his old age. <br>Tell kings that remedy avails no more, <br>&#039;Tis waste of words, that but excites their rage. <br>Ours ordered doctors in of every kind, <br>For skilled there are in every branch we find. <br>They to the lion came from their retreats, <br>From every side came givers of receipts. <br>Among the visitors to show their skill, <br>The fox dispensed with going, and lay still. <br>Hence fawned the wolf, his absent friend belied, <br>As the king went to bed, when quick he cried: <br>"He shall be stifled in his room with smoke! <br>First bring him here." The fox appeared and spoke, <br>Knowing the wolf had injured him at court: <br>"Sire, I&#039;m afraid that some unfair report <br>May for contempt have taken my delay <br>Thus to condole with you, and homage pay. <br>I&#039;ve been, dread sire, on pilgrimage by stealth, <br>To pay the vows I promised for your health. <br>Wise men and skilful met I on the way;<br>And your own fears from danger but too great. <br>Sire, all you want, they said, is heat, <br>Which age in you has quenched within; <br>Of a wolf flayed alive, then, wear the skin, <br>Quite hot and smoking from his body peeled; <br>A secret doubtless ne&#039;er before revealed: <br>It gives to wasting nature life and ease. <br>Here good Sir Wolf will serve you, if you please, <br>With chamber robe so very choice." <br>The monarch relished the advice: <br>The wolf was flayed, and cut up in a trice; <br>Warm in his skin the king wrapt up, <br>Upon his body straight sat down to sup. <br>Cease, courtiers, cease to work each other&#039;s woe, <br>And while ye flatter, deal no treacherous blow: <br>Quadruple wrath may wait you on the throne, <br>Which ye think calumny has made your own. <br>Ye run a race, and as the swiftest choose, <br>Nothing is pardoned to the men that lose.

The Monkey and the Fishermen
  A MONKEY perched upon a lofty tree saw some Fishermen casting their nets into a river, and narrowly watched their proceedings.  The Fishermen after a while gave up fishing, and on going home to dinner left their nets upon the bank. The Monkey, who is the most imitative of animals, descended from the treetop and endeavored to do as they had done. Having handled the net, he threw it into the river, but became tangled in the meshes and drowned. With his last breath he said to himself, &quot;I am rightly served; for what business had I who had never handled a net to try and catch fish?&#039;

The Mouse, the Bird, and the Sausage
Once upon a time a mouse, a bird, and a sausage formed a partnership. They kept house together, and for a long time they lived in peace and prosperity, acquiring many possessions. The bird&#039;s task was to fly into the forest every day to fetch wood. The mouse carried water, made the fire, and set the table. The sausage did the cooking.<p>Whoever is too well off always wants to try something different! Thus one day the bird chanced to meet another bird, who boasted to him of his own situation. This bird criticized him for working so hard while the other two enjoyed themselves at home. For after the mouse had made the fire and carried the water, she could sit in the parlor and rest until it was time for her to set the table. The sausage had only to stay by the pot watching the food cook. When mealtime approached, she would slither through the porridge or the vegetables, and thus everything was greased and salted and ready to eat. The bird would bring his load of wood home. They would eat their meal, and then sleep soundly until the next morning. It was a great life.<p>The next day, because of his friend&#039;s advice, the bird refused to go to the forest, saying that he had been their servant long enough. He was no longer going to be a fool for them. Everyone should try a different task for a change. The mouse and the sausage argued against this, but the bird was the master, and he insisted that they give it a try. The sausage was to fetch wood, the mouse became the cook, and the bird was to carry water.<p>And what was the result? The sausage trudged off toward the forest; the bird made the fire; and the mouse put on the pot and waited for the sausage to return with wood for the next day. However, the sausage stayed out so long that the other two feared that something bad had happened. The bird flew off to see if he could find her. A short distance away he came upon a dog that had seized the sausage as free booty and was making off with her. The bird complained bitterly to the dog about this brazen abduction, but he claimed that he had discovered forged letters on the sausage, and that she would thus have to forfeit her life to him.<p>Filled with sorrow, the bird carried the wood home himself and told the mouse what he had seen and heard. They were very sad, but were determined to stay together and make the best of it. The bird set the table while the mouse prepared the food. She jumped into the pot, as the sausage had always done, in order to slither and weave in and about the vegetables and grease them, but before she reached the middle, her hair and skin were scalded off, and she perished.<p>When the bird wanted to eat, no cook was there. Beside himself, he threw the wood this way and that, called out, looked everywhere, but no cook was to be found. Because of his carelessness, the scattered wood caught fire, and the entire house was soon aflame. The bird rushed to fetch water, but the bucket fell into the well, carrying him with it, and he drowned.

The Mouse, the Frog, and the Hawk
  A MOUSE who always lived on the land, by an unlucky chance formed an intimate acquaintance with a Frog, who lived for the most part in the water. The Frog, one day intent on mischief, bound the foot of the Mouse tightly to his own. Thus joined together, the Frog first of all led his friend the Mouse to the meadow where they were accustomed to find their food. After this, he gradually led him towards the pool in which he lived, until reaching the very brink, he suddenly jumped in, dragging the Mouse with him. The Frog enjoyed the water amazingly, and swam croaking about, as if he had done a good deed. The unhappy Mouse was soon suffocated by the water, and his dead body floated about on the surface, tied to the foot of the Frog. A Hawk observed it, and, pouncing upon it with his talons, carried it aloft. The Frog, being still fastened to the leg of the Mouse, was also carried off a prisoner, and was eaten by the Hawk.  Harm hatch, harm catch.

The North Wind and the Sun
  THE NORTH WIND and the Sun disputed as to which was the most powerful, and agreed that he should be declared the victor who could first strip a wayfaring man of his clothes. The North Wind first tried his power and blew with all his might, but the keener his blasts, the closer the Traveler wrapped his cloak around him, until at last, resigning all hope of victory, the Wind called upon the Sun to see what he could do. The Sun suddenly shone out with all his warmth. The Traveler no sooner felt his genial rays than he took off one garment after another, and at last, fairly overcome with heat, undressed and bathed in a stream that lay in his path.  Persuasion is better than Force.

The Raven and the Fox 
This truth within the heart is graven :— <br>All flattery is false ; and so, there&#039;s no excuse, <br>If listeners succumb when flatterers seduce. <p>Up on a little fir-tree lightly hopped a raven <br>That wished to breakfast at her ease, <br>And carried in her mouth a piece of fragrant cheese. <br>But while she pondered, then a morsel tasted, <br>A fox adjudged the chance too perfect to be wasted. <br>Was taken captive by the cheesy scent ; <br>On looking up, no further on his journey went. <br>The rogue, on tip-toe, to the fir-tree slow approaches. <br>Upon the bird&#039;s attention sly encroaches. <br>And gently says, in accents low and clear :— <br>"Oh, songster exquisite and dear. <br>Your eyes are soft with love and pity, <br>I humbly bow to one so pretty. <br>Ne&#039;er have I seen such feathers, such a beak ! <br>Oh, queen of all the birds ! but let me hear you speak. <br>Or rather, deign to sing ! Enjoy a moment&#039;s leisure <br>And charm the world with tones delightful beyond  measure. <br>Pour forth fine notes, my gracious treasure ! " <br>The raven held her breath, and nearly died from choking, <br>And then, as if a wild ambition in her burned. <br>She opened wide her mouth for harsh discordant croaking. <br>And the fox gained the cheese his cunning skill had earned. <br>

The Robbers and the Farm Animals
Once upon a time there was a miller&#039;s servant who had served his master faithfully and diligently for many years. He had grown old in the mill, and the heavy work that he had to do there finally surpassed his strength. So one day he said to his master: "I can no longer serve you; I am too weak. I am therefore asking you for my dismissal and my wages."<p>The miller said: "The time of wandering servants has passed. You are free to leave if you wish, but you will receive no wages.<p>Now the old servant would sooner give up his wages than to continue to be tormented in the mill, so he took leave from his master.<p>Before leaving home he went to the animals that until now he had fed and tended, in order to bid them farewell. While taking leave from the horse, it said to him: "Where are you going?"<p>"I have to leave," he said. "I cannot take it here any longer." And when he set forth, the horse followed along after him.<p>He then went to the ox, stroked him once again, and said: "God be with you, old fellow!"<p>"Where are you going?" spoke the ox.<p>"Oh, I must leave. I cannot take it here any longer," said the miller&#039;s servant and sadly went on his way to take leave from the dog. The ox followed along behind, just as the horse had done. And the other animals to whom he said farewell -- the dog, the cat, and the goose -- all did the same thing.<p>He made his way out into the country, where he first noticed that the faithful animals were following him. He spoke to them in a friendly manner, asking them to turn around and return home. "I have nothing more for myself," he said, "and I can no longer care for you." But the animals told him that they would not abandon him, and they contentedly followed along behind.<p>After several days they came to a great forest. Here the horse and the ox found good grass, which the goose and the rooster enjoyed as well. However, the other animals -- the cat and the dog -- had to suffer hunger, as did the old miller&#039;s servant; but they did not grumble and complain. Finally, after having gone very deep into the forest, they suddenly saw a large, beautiful house before them. It was locked up securely. Only an empty stall was open, and from here they could go through the barn into the house itself.<p>Because no one could be seen in the house, the servant decided to stay there with his animals, and he assigned each one to a place. He put the horse up front in the stall. He led the ox to the other side. The rooster was given a place on the roof, the dog on the manure pile, the cat on the hearth, and the goose behind the stove. Then he gave each one his feed, which was plentifully stored in the house. He himself ate and drank all he wanted, then fell asleep in a good bed, which was all made up in the bedroom.<p>During the night, while he was fast asleep, the robber -- who owned the forest house -- returned. As he stepped into yard, the dog jumped on him furiously, and barked at him. The rooster cried down from the roof: "Cock-a-doodle-doo, cock-a-doodle-doo!" All this terrified the robber, for he had never seen farm animals that live with people, knowing instead only the wild animals of the forest. He fled hurriedly into the stall, but there the horse kicked out from behind, hitting him in the side. He staggered around and around, and only with difficulty could he retreat into the back part of the stall. He scarcely arrived there when the ox turned around and tried to pick him up on his horns. This frightened him anew, and he ran as fast as he could through the barn and into the kitchen, where he wanted to strike a light and see what was there. Feeling around the hearth, he touched the cat, which jumped on him and scratched him with its claws until jumped away head over heels, and tried to hide behind the stove in the main room. The goose jumped up, screaming and beating its wings. The terrified robber fled into the bedroom. There the miller&#039;s servant was snoring mightily like a purring spinning wheel, and the robber thought the entire room was filled with strangers. You had better believe that he was overcome by a terrible fear. He rushed out of the house and ran into the woods, not stopping until until he had found his fellow robbers.<p>He began talking: "I don&#039;t know what has happened in our house. Some strange people are living there. When I stepped into the yard a large wildman jumped at me, yelling and bellowing so terribly that I thought he would kill me. An another one cheered him on, calling down from the roof: &#039;Hit him for me too! Hit him for me too!&#039; The first one was bad enough; I wasn&#039;t going to wait for more of them to jump me, so I fled into the stall. There a shoemaker threw a last at my side, and I can still feel where it hit. I ran to the back of the stall. A pitchfork maker was standing there who tried to impale me on his pitchfork. I ran into the kitchen, where a hackle maker beat me with his hackle [a sharp-toothed tool for combing flax]. I tried to hide behind the stove, but there was a shovel maker there who beat me with his shovel. Finally I ran into the bedroom, but there were so many others snoring in there that was happy to escape with my life."<p>When the robbers heard this, they were so horrified that not a one of them had any desire to enter the house. To the contrary, they believed that the entire region was threatened by these strange people. That same night they departed for another country, and they never returned.<p>The miller&#039;s servant lived in peace in the robbers&#039; house with his faithful animals. He no longer had to suffer in his old age, for the beautiful garden next to the house produced more fruit, vegetables, and all kinds of food every year than he and his animals could eat.<br>

The Salt Merchant and His Ass
  A PEDDLER drove his Ass to the seashore to buy salt. His road home lay across a stream into which his Ass, making a false step, fell by accident and rose up again with his load considerably lighter, as the water melted the sack. The Peddler retraced his steps and refilled his panniers with a larger quantity of salt than before. When he came again to the stream, the Ass fell down on purpose in the same spot, and, regaining his feet with the weight of his load much diminished, brayed triumphantly as if he had obtained what he desired. The Peddler saw through his trick and drove him for the third time to the coast, where he bought a cargo of sponges instead of salt. The Ass, again playing the fool, fell down on purpose when he reached the stream, but the sponges became swollen with water, greatly increasing his load.  And thus his trick recoiled on him, for he now carried on his back a double burden.

The Sheep And The Pig Who Set Up House
Once on a time there was a sheep who stood in the pen to be fattened; so he lived well, and was stuffed and crammed with everything that was good. So it went on, till, one day, the dairymaid came and gave him still more food, and then she said,<p>&#039;Eat away, sheep; you won&#039;t be much longer here; we are going to kill you to-morrow.&#039;<p>It is an old saying, that women&#039;s counsel is always worth having, and that there is a cure and physic for everything but death. &#039;But, after all,&#039; said the sheep to himself, &#039;there may be a cure even for death this time.&#039;<p>So he ate till he was ready to burst; and when he was crammed full, he butted out the door of the pen, and took his way to the neighbouring farm. There he went to the pigsty to a pig whom he had known out on the common, and ever since had been the best friends with.<p>&#039;Good day!&#039; said the sheep, &#039;and thanks for our last merry meeting.&#039;<p>&#039;Good day!&#039; answered the pig, &#039;and the same to you.&#039;<p>&#039;Do you know,&#039; said the sheep, &#039;why it is you are so well off, and why it is they fatten you and take such pains with you?&#039;<p>&#039;No, I don&#039;t,&#039; said the pig.<p>&#039;Many a flask empties the cask; I suppose you know that,&#039; said the sheep. &#039;They are going to kill and eat you.&#039;<p>&#039;Are they?&#039; said the pig; &#039;well, I hope they&#039;ll say grace after meat.&#039;<p>&#039;If you will do as I do,&#039; said the sheep, &#039;we&#039;ll go off to the wood, build us a house, and set up for ourselves. A home is a home be it ever so homely.&#039;<p>Yes! the pig was willing enough. &#039;Good company is such a comfort,&#039; he said, and so the two set off.<p>So, when they had gone a bit they met a goose.<p>&#039;Good day, good sirs, and thanks for our last merry meeting,&#039; said the goose; &#039;whither away so fast to-day?&#039;<p>&#039;Good day, and the same to you,&#039; said the sheep; &#039;you must know we were too well off at home, and so we are going to set up for ourselves in the wood, for you know every man&#039;s house is his castle.&#039;<p>&#039;Well!&#039; said the goose, &#039;it&#039;s much the same with me where I am. Can&#039;t I go with you too, for it&#039;s child&#039;s play when three share the day.&#039;<p>&#039;With gossip and gabble is built neither house nor stable,&#039; said the pig, &#039;let us know what you can do.&#039;<p>&#039;By cunning and skill a cripple can do what he will,&#039; said the goose. &#039;I can pluck moss and stuff it into the seams of the planks, and your house will be tight and warm.&#039;<p>Yes! they would give him leave, for, above all things piggy wished to be warm and comfortable.<p>So, when they had gone a bit farther--the goose had hard work to walk so fast--they met a hare, who came frisking out of the wood.<p>&#039;Good day, good sirs, and thanks for our last merry meeting,&#039; she said, &#039;how far are you trotting to-day?&#039;<p>&#039;Good day, and the same to you,&#039; said the sheep; &#039;we were far too well off at home, and so we&#039;re going to the wood, to build us a house, and set up for ourselves, for you know, try all the world round, there&#039;s nothing like home.&#039;<p>&#039;As for that,&#039; said the hare, &#039;I have a house in every bush--yes, a house in every bush; but, yet, I have often said, in winter, &#039;if I only live till summer, I&#039;ll build me a house;&#039; and so I have half a mind to go with you and build one up, after all.&#039;<p>&#039;Yes!&#039; said the pig, &#039;if we ever get into a scrape, we might use you to scare away the dogs, for you don&#039;t fancy you could help us in house building.&#039;<p>&#039;He who lives long enough always finds work enough to do,&#039; said the hare. &#039;I have teeth to gnaw pegs, and paws to drive them into the wall, so I can very well set up to be a carpenter, for "good tools make good work," as the man said, when he flayed the mare with a gimlet.&#039;<p>Yes! he too got leave to go with them and build their house, there was nothing more to be said about it.<p>When they had gone a bit farther they met a cock.<p>&#039;Good day, good sirs,&#039; said the cock, &#039;and thanks for our last merry meeting; whither are ye going to-day, gentlemen?&#039;<p>&#039;Good day, and the same to you,&#039; said the sheep. &#039;At home we were too well off, and so we are going off to the wood to build us a house, and set up for ourselves; for he who out of doors shall bake, loses at last both coal and cake.&#039;<p>&#039;Well!&#039; said the cock, &#039;that&#039;s just my case; but it&#039;s better to sit on one&#039;s own perch, for then one can never be left in the lurch, and, besides, all cocks crow loudest at home. Now, if I might have leave to join such a gallant company, I also would like to go to the wood and build a house.&#039;<p>&#039;Ay! ay!&#039; said the pig, &#039;flapping and crowing sets tongues a-going; but a jaw on a stick never yet laid a brick. How can you ever help us to build a house?&#039;<p>&#039;Oh!&#039; said the cock, &#039;that house will never have a clock, where there is neither dog nor cock. I am up early, and I wake every one.&#039;<p>&#039;Very true,&#039; said the pig, &#039;the morning hour has a golden dower; let him come with us;&#039; for, you must know, piggy was always the soundest sleeper. &#039;Sleep is the biggest thief,&#039; he said; &#039;he thinks nothing of stealing half one&#039;s life.&#039;<p>So they all set off to the wood, as a band and brotherhood, and built the house. The pig hewed the timber, and the sheep drew it home; the hare was carpenter, and gnawed pegs and bolts, and hammered them into the walls and roof; the goose plucked moss and stuffed it into the seams; the cock crew, and looked out that they did not oversleep themselves in the morning; and when the house was ready, and the roof lined with birch bark, and thatched with turf; there they lived by themselves, and were merry and well. &#039;&#039;Tis good to travel east and west,&#039; said the sheep, &#039;but after all a home is best.&#039;<p>But you must know that a bit farther on in the wood was a wolf&#039;s den, and there lived two graylegs. So when they saw that a new house had risen up hard by, they wanted to know what sort of folk their neighbours were, for they thought to themselves that a good neighbour was better than a brother in a foreign land, and that it was better to live in a good neighbourhood than to know many people miles and miles off.<p>So one of them made up an errand, and went into the new house and asked for a light for his pipe. But as soon as ever he got inside the door, the sheep gave him such a butt that he fell head foremost into the stove. Then the pig began to gore and bite him, the goose to nip and peck him, the cock upon the roost to crow and chatter; and as for the hare he was so frightened out of his wits, that he ran about aloft and on the floor, and scratched and scrambled in every corner of the house.<p>So after a long time the wolf came out.<p>&#039;Well!&#039; said the one who waited for him outside, &#039;neighbourhood makes brotherhood. You must have come into a perfect paradise on bare earth, since you stayed so long. But what became of the light, for you have neither pipe nor smoke.&#039;<p>&#039;Yes, yes!&#039; said the other; &#039;it was just a nice light and a pleasant company. Such manners I never saw in all my life. But then you know we can&#039;t pick and choose in this wicked world, and an unbidden guest gets bad treatment. As soon as I got inside the door, the shoe-maker let fly at me with his last, so that I fell head foremost into the stithy fire; and there sat two smiths who blew the bellows and made the sparks fly, and beat and punched me with red hot tongs and pincers, so that they tore whole pieces out of my body. As for the hunter he went scrambling about looking for his gun, and it was good luck he did not find it. And all the while there was another who sat up under the roof, and slapped his arms and sang out,<p>&#039;Put a hook into him, and drag him hither, drag him hither.&#039; That was what he screamed, and if he had only got hold of me, I should never have come out alive.<br>

The sparrow and his four children
A sparrow had four young ones in a swallow&#039;s nest. When they were fledged, some naughty boys pulled out the nest, but fortunately all the birds got safely away in the high wind. Then the old bird was grieved that as his sons had all gone out into the world, he had not first warned them of every kind of danger, and given them good instruction how to deal with each. In the autumn a great many sparrows assembled together in a wheatfield, and there the old bird met his four children again, and full of joy took them home with him. "Ah, my dear sons, what pain I have been in about you all through the summer, because you got away in the wind without my teaching; listen to my words, obey your father, and be well on your guard. Little birds have to encounter great dangers!" And then he asked the eldest where he had spent the summer, and how he had supported himself? "I stayed in the gardens, and looked for caterpillars and small worms, until the cherries got ripe." - "Ah, my son," said the father, "tit-bits are not bad, but there is great risk about them; on that account take great care of thyself henceforth, and particularly when people are going about the gardens who carry long green poles which are hollow inside and have a little hole at the top." - "Yes, father, but what if a little green leaf is stuck over the hole with wax?" said the son. "Where hast thou seen that?" - "In a merchant&#039;s garden," said the youngster. "Oh, my son, merchant folks are quick folks," said the father. "If thou hast been among the children of the world, thou hast learned worldly shiftiness enough, only see that thou usest it well, and do not be too confident." After this he asked the next, "Where hast thou passed thy time?" - "At court," said the son. "Sparrows and silly little birds are of no use in that place -- there one finds much gold, velvet, silk, armour, harnesses, sparrow-hawks, screech-owls and hen-harriers; keep to the horses&#039; stable where they winnow oats, or thresh, and then fortune may give thee thy daily grain of corn in peace." - "Yes, father," said the son, "but when the stable-boys make traps and fix their gins and snares in the straw, many a one is caught fast." Where hast thou seen that?" said the old bird. "At court, among the stable-boys." - "Oh, my son, court boys are bad boys! If thou hast been to court and among the lords, and hast left no feathers there, thou hast learnt a fair amount, and wilt know very well how to go about the world, but look around thee and above thee, for the wolves devour the wisest dogs." The father examined the third also: "Where didst thou seek thy safety?" - "I have broken up tubs and ropes on the cart-roads and highways, and sometimes met with a grain of corn or barley." - "That is indeed dainty fare," said the father, "but take care what thou art about and look carefully around, especially when thou seest any one stooping and about to pick up a stone, there is not much time to stay then." - "That is true," said the son, "but what if any one should carry a bit of rock, or ore, ready beforehand in his breast or pocket?" - "Where hast thou seen that?" - "Among the mountaineers, dear father; when they go out, they generally take little bits of ore with them." - "Mountain folks are working folks, and clever folks. If thou hast been among mountain lads, thou hast seen and learnt something, but when thou goest thither beware, for many a sparrow has been brought to a bad end by a mountain boy." At length the father came to the youngest son: "Thou, my dear chirping nestling, wert always the silliest and weakest; stay with me, the world has many rough, wicked birds which have crooked beaks and long claws, and lie in wait for poor little birds and swallow them. Keep with those of thine own kind, and pick up little spiders and caterpillars from the trees, or the house, and then thou wilt live long in peace." - "My dear father, he who feeds himself without injury to other people fares well, and no sparrow-hawk, eagle, or kite will hurt him if he specially commits himself and his lawful food, evening and morning, faithfully to God, who is the Creator and Preserver of all forest and village birds, who likewise heareth the cry and prayer of the young ravens, for no sparrow or wren ever falls to the ground except by his will." - "Where hast thou learnt this?" The son answered, "When the great blast of wind tore me away from thee I came to a church, and there during the summer I have picked up the flies and spiders from the windows, and heard this discourse preached. The Father of all sparrows fed me all the summer through, and kept me from all mischance and from ferocious birds." <p>"In sooth, my dear son, if thou takest refuge in the churches and helpest to clear away spiders and buzzing flies, and criest unto God like the young ravens, and commendest thyself to the eternal Creator, all will be well with thee, and that even if the whole world were full of wild malicious birds." <p>"He who to God commits his ways,<p>In silence suffers, waits, and prays,<p>Preserves his faith and conscience pure,<p>He is of God&#039;s protection sure."

The Spider and the Turtle
One day Anansi the spider picked some very fat and tasty vegetables from his garden. He baked them with much care and they came out smelling delicious. He could not wait to sit down and eat them. <p>Just then there was a knock at his door. It was Turtle, who had been traveling all day and was very tired and hungry. <p>"Hello, Anansi," said Turtle. "I have been walking for so long, and I smelt the most delicious vegetables I have ever smelt. Would you be so kind as to share your meal with me?"<p>Anansi could not refuse, for it was the custom in his country to share your meal with visitors at mealtime. But he was not very happy, for Anansi was a little too greedy and wanted the delicious vegetables all to himself. So Anansi thought for a while and came up with a scheme. <p>"Please do come in, Turtle. I would be honored to have you as my guest this evening. Sit down, grab a chair and help yourself. "<p>Turtle came inside and sat down, but just as he reached for a vegetable, Anansi yelled, "Turtle, don&#039;t you know better than to come to the table with dirty hands?"<p>Turtle looked down at his hands and saw that they were filthy. He had been crawling all day and had not had a chance to clean up. Turtle got up and went to the river to clean his feet. He walked, slowly like all turtles, all the way back up to the house, and when he returned, Anansi had already begun to eat. <p>"I didn&#039;t want these tasty vegetables to get cold, so I had to begin," said Anansi. "But please do join me now, Turtle. "<p>Turtle sat down again and reached for a vegetable, but again Anansi yelled at him. <p>"Turtle, did you not hear me before? It is not polite to come to the table with dirty hands!"<p>He looked down and saw that his clean hands had turned dirty once more, since he had to crawl on them to get back to the house. So he walked down to the river once more to wash himself. And when he returned this time, he was careful to walk on the grass so his hands would stay clean. But by the time he sat down at the table, Anansi had finished up the tasty vegetables and not a single bit was left. <p>Turtle looked at Anansi for a moment and then said, "Thank you for sharing your meal with me. If you ever find yourself near my house, please let me return the favour. "And then he slowly walked out the door and continued his way. <p>The days went by and Anansi thought more and more of that meal that Turtle had offered. He got more and more interested in a free dinner and finally could not stand it anymore. He set off one day to find Turtle&#039;s house. <p>He found Turtle sunning himself on a riverbank just around dinnertime. <p>Turtle looked up and said, "Hello, Anansi, have you come to share an evening meal with me?"<p>"Oh yes, yes!" said Anansi, who was growing hungrier and hungrier by the minute. Turtle went underwater to his house to set the dinner table for dinner. Soon he came back to the bank and said, "Your place is waiting and the food is ready. Please join me, Anansi. "<p>And then he dived underwater and began to slowly eat his meal. <p>Anansi jumped into the water, but could not get down to the bottom of the river. He tried to swim down, but he was so light that he kept popping back up to the surface. <p>He tried diving, and he tried a backcrawl. He tried a running jump, but nothing would help him get down to the river bottom. <p>In the meantime, Turtle was slowly eating his meal. <p>Anansi was not about to give up a free meal, and went to the riverside wondering what he would do. Finally he had an idea. He started grabbing stones and rocks and stuffed them into his jacket pockets. <p>Now when he jumped into the water he sank right down to the bottom and was able to take his place at the table. <p>The table was a beautiful banquet full of delicious foods. Anansi could hardly believe how many tasty food was before him and could not wait to start. <p>But just as he reached for the first morsel, Turtle stopped eating and said: "In my country, we do not wear our jackets to the table. "<p>Anansi noticed that Turtle had removed his own jacket before sitting down. Anansi started to remove his jacket, and as soon as it was off of his shoulders, he went straight back up to the surface. He stuck his head down into the water and saw Turtle, down there, slowly enjoying that wonderful banquet. <br>

The Three Billy-Goats Gruff
ONCE on a time there were three Billy-goats, who were to go up to the hill-side to make themselves fat, and the name of all three was "Gruff."<p>On the way up was a bridge over a burn they had to cross; and under the bridge lived a great ugly Troll, with eyes as big as saucers, and a nose as long as a poker.<p>So first of all came the youngest billy-goat Gruff to cross the bridge.<p>"Trip, trap! trip, trap!" went the bridge.<p>"WHO&#039;S THAT tripping over my bridge?" roared the Troll.<p>"Oh, it is only I, the tiniest billy-goat Gruff; and I&#039;m going up to the hill-side to make myself fat," said the billy-goat, with such a small voice.<p>"Now, I&#039;m coming, to gobble you up," said the Troll.<p>"Oh, no! pray don&#039;t take me. I&#039;m too little, that I am," said the billy-goat; "wait a bit till the second billy-goat Gruff comes, he&#039;s much bigger."<p>"Well, be off with you;" said the Troll.<p>A little while after came the second billy-goat Gruff to cross the bridge.<p>"TRIP, TRAP! TRIP, TRAP! TRIP, TRAP!" went the bridge.<p>"WHO&#039;S THAT tripping over my bridge?" roared the Troll.<p>"Oh, it&#039;s the second billy-goat Gruff, and I&#039;m going up to the hill-side to make myself fat," said the billy-goat, who hadn&#039;t such a small voice.<p>"Now I&#039;m coming to gobble you up," said the Troll.<p>"Oh, no! don&#039;t take me, wait a little till the big billy-goat Gruff comes, he&#039;s much bigger."<p>"Very well! be off with you," said the Troll.<p>But just then up came the big billy-goat Gruff.<p>"TRIP, TRAP! TRIP, TRAP! TRIP, TRAP!" went the bridge, for the billy-goat was so heavy that the bridge creaked and groaned under him.<p>"WHO&#039;S THAT tramping over my bridge?" roared the Troll.<p>"IT&#039;S I! THE BIG BILLY-GOAT GRUFF," said the billy-goat, who had an ugly hoarse voice of his own.<p>"Now I&#039;m coming to gobble you up," roared the Troll,<p><br>"Well, come along! I&#039;ve got two spears,<p>And I&#039;ll poke your eyeballs out at your ears;<p>I&#039;ve got besides two curling-stones,<p>And I&#039;ll crush you to bits, body and bones."<p>That was what the big billy-goat said; and so he flew at the Troll, and poked his eyes out with his horns, and crushed him to bits, body and bones, and tossed him out into the burn, and after that he went up to the hill-side. There the billy-goats got so fat they were scarce able to walk home again; and if the fat hasn&#039;t fallen off them, why, they&#039;re still fat; and so—<p>"Snip, snap, snout<br>This tale&#039;s told out."<br>

The Tortoise and the Eagle
A TORTOISE, lazily basking in the sun, complained to the<br>sea-birds of her hard fate, that no one would teach her to fly. <br>An Eagle, hovering near, heard her lamentation and demanded what<br>reward she would give him if he would take her aloft and float<br>her in the air. "I will give you," she said, "all the riches of<br>the Red Sea." "I will teach you to fly then," said the Eagle; and<br>taking her up in his talons he carried her almost to the clouds <br>suddenly he let her go, and she fell on a lofty mountain, dashing<br>her shell to pieces.

The Town-mouse And The Fell-mouse
Once on a time there was a fell-mouse and a town-mouse, and they met on a hill brae, where the fell-mouse sat in a hazel thicket and plucked nuts.<p>&#039;God help you, sister,&#039; said the town-mouse. &#039;Do I meet my kinsfolk here so far out in the country?&#039;<p>&#039;Yes! so it is;&#039; said the fell-mouse.<p>&#039;You gather these nuts and carry them to your house?&#039; said the town-mouse.<p>&#039;Yes; I must do it,&#039; said the fell-mouse, &#039;if we are to have anything to live on.&#039;<p>&#039;The husks are long and the kernels full this year,&#039; said the town-mouse; &#039;so I dare say they will help to fill out a starveling body.&#039;<p>&#039;You are quite right,&#039; said the fell-mouse, and then she told her how well and happily she lived. But the town-mouse thought she was better off, and the fell-mouse would not give in, but said there was no place so good as wood and fell, and as for herself, she had far the best of it.<p>Still the town-mouse said she was sure she had the best of it, and they could not agree at all. So, at last, they promised to pay one another a visit at Yule, that they might taste and see which lived best. The town-mouse was the one that had to pay the first visit, and she went through woods and deep dales, for though the fell-mouse had come down to the lowlands for the winter, the road was both long and heavy. It was up-hill work, and the snow was both deep and soft, so that she was both weary and hungry by the time she got to her journey&#039;s end.<p>&#039;Now I shall be glad to get some food,&#039; she said, when she got there. As for the fell-mouse, she had scraped together all sorts of good things. There were kernels of nuts, and liquorish-root and other roots, and much else that grows in wood and field. All this she had in a hole deep under ground where it would not freeze, and close by was a spring which was open all the winter, so that she could drink as much water as she chose. There was plenty of what was to be had, and they fed both well and good; but the town-mouse thought it was not more than sorry fare.<p>&#039;One can keep life together with this,&#039; she said; &#039;but it isn&#039;t choice, not at all. But now you must be so kind as come to me, and taste what we have in town.&#039;<p>Well, the fell-mouse was willing, and it was not long before she came. Then the town-mouse had gathered together something of all the Christmas fare which the mistress of the house had dropped as she went about, when she had taken a drop too much at Yule. There were bits of cheese, and odds and ends of butter and tallow, and cheesecakes and tipsycake, and much else that was nice. In the jar under the ale-tap she had drink enough, and the whole room was full of all kinds of dainties. They fed and lived well, and there was no end to the fell-mouse&#039;s greediness. Such fare she had never tasted. At last, she got thirsty, for the food was both strong and rich, and now she must have a drink of water.<p>&#039;It is not far off to the ale,&#039; said the town-mouse; &#039;that&#039;s the drink for us;&#039; and with that she jumped up on the edge of the jar, and drank her thirst out, but she drank no more than she could carry, for she knew the Yule ale and how strong it was. But as for the fell-mouse, she thought it famous drink, for she had never tasted anything but water, and now she took sip after sip; but she was no judge of strong drink, and so the end was she got drunk, for she tumbled down and got wild in her head, and felt her feet tingle, till she began to run and to jump about from one beer-barrel to the other, and to dance and cut capers on the shelves among the cups and jugs, and to whistle and whine, just as though she were tipsy and silly; and tipsy she was, there was no gainsaying it.<p>&#039;You mustn&#039;t behave as though you had just come from the hills,&#039; said the town-mouse. &#039;Don&#039;t make such a noise, and don&#039;t lead us such a life; we have a hard master here.&#039;<p>But the fell-mouse said: &#039;She cared not a pin for man or master!&#039;<p>But all this while the cat sat up on the trap-door above the cellar, and listened and spied both to their talk and pranks. Just then, the goody came down to draw a mug of ale, and as she lifted the trap-door, the cat stole into the cellar and fixed her claws into the fell-mouse. Then there was another dance. The town-mouse crept into her hole, and sat safe looking on, but the fell-mouse got sober all at once as soon as she felt the cat&#039;s claws.<p>&#039;Oh, my dear master, my dear master; be merciful and spare my life, and I&#039;ll tell you a story.&#039; That was what she said.<p>&#039;Out with it then,&#039; said the cat.<p>&#039;Once on a time there were two small mice,&#039; said the fell-mouse; and she squeaked so pitifully and slowly, for she wanted to drag the story out as long as she could.<p>&#039;Then they were not alone,&#039; said the cat, both sharply and drily.<p>&#039;And so we had a steak we were going to cook.&#039;<p>&#039;Then you were not starved,&#039; said the cat.<p>&#039;So we put it up on the roof that it might cool itself well,&#039; said the fell-mouse.<p>&#039;Then you didn&#039;t burn your tongues,&#039; said the cat.<p>&#039;So, then the fox and the crow came and gobbled it up,&#039; said the fell-mouse.<p>&#039;And so I&#039;ll gobble you up,&#039; said the cat.<p>But just then the goody slammed to the trap-door again, so that the cat got afraid and loosed her hold, and--pop--the fell-mouse was away in the town-mouse&#039;s hole, and from it there was a way out into the snow, and the fell-mouse was not slow in setting off home.<p>&#039;This you call living well, and you say that you live best?&#039; she said to the town-mouse. &#039;Heaven help me to a better mind, for with such a big house, and such a hawk for a master I could scarce get off with my life.<br>

The Way Of The World
Once on a time, there was a man who went into the wood to cut hop-poles, but he could find no trees so long and straight, and slender, as he wanted, till he came high up under a great heap of stones. There he heard groans and moans as though some one were at Death&#039;s door. So he went up to see who it was that needed help, and then he heard that the noise came from under a great flat stone which lay upon the heap. It was so heavy it would have taken many a man to lift it. But the man went down again into the wood and cut down a tree, which he turned into a lever, and with that he tilted up the stone, and lo! out from under it crawled a Dragon, and made at the man to swallow him up. But the man said he had saved the Dragon&#039;s life, and it was shameful thanklessness in him to want to eat him up.<p>&#039;May be,&#039; said the Dragon; &#039;but you might very well know I must be starved when I have been here hundreds of years and never tasted meat. Besides, it&#039;s the way of the world,--that&#039;s how it pays its debts.&#039;<p>The man pleaded his cause stoutly, and begged prettily for his life; and at last they agreed to take the first living thing that came for a daysman, and if his doom went the other way the man should not lose his life, but if he said the same as the Dragon, the Dragon should eat the man.<p>The first thing that came was an old hound, who ran along the road down below under the hillside. Him they spoke to, and begged him to be judge.<p>&#039;God knows,&#039; said the hound, &#039;I have served my master truly ever since I was a little whelp. I have watched and watched many and many a night through, while he lay warm asleep on his ear, and I have saved house and home from fire and thieves more than once; but now I can neither see nor hear any more, and he wants to shoot me. And so I must run away, and slink from house to house, and beg for my living till I die of hunger. No! it&#039;s the way of the world,&#039; said the hound; &#039;that&#039;s how it pays its debts.&#039;<p>&#039;Now I am coming to eat you up,&#039; said the Dragon, and tried to swallow the man again. But the man begged and prayed hard for his life, till they agreed to take the next comer for a judge; and if he said the same as the Dragon and the Hound, the Dragon was to eat him, and get a meal of man&#039;s meat; but if he did not say so, the man was to get off with his life.<p>So there came an old horse limping down along the road which ran under the hill. Him they called out to come and settle the dispute. Yes; he was quite ready to do that.<p>&#039;Now, I have served my master,&#039; said the horse, &#039;as long as I could draw or carry. I have slaved and striven for him till the sweat trickled from every hair, and I have worked till I have grown lame, and halt, and worn out with toil and age; now I am fit for nothing. I am not worth my food, and so I am to have a bullet through me, he says. Nay! nay! It&#039;s the way of the world. That&#039;s how the world pays its debts.&#039;<p>&#039;Well, now I&#039;m coming to eat you,&#039; said the Dragon, who gaped wide, and wanted to swallow the man. But he begged again hard for his life.<p>But the Dragon said he must have a mouthful of man&#039;s meat; he was so hungry, he couldn&#039;t bear it any longer.<p>&#039;See, yonder comes one who looks as if he was sent to be a judge between us,&#039; said the man, as he pointed to Reynard the fox, who came stealing between the stones of the heap.<p>&#039;All good things are three,&#039; said the man; &#039;let me ask him, too, and if he gives doom like the others, eat me up on the spot.&#039;<p>&#039;Very well,&#039; said the Dragon. He, too, had heard that all good things were three, and so it should be a bargain. So the man talked to the fox as he had talked to the others.<p>&#039;Yes, yes,&#039; said Reynard; &#039;I see how it all is;&#039; but as he said this he took the man a little on one side.<p>&#039;What will you give me if I free you from the Dragon?&#039; he whispered into the man&#039;s ear.<p>&#039;You shall be free to come to my house, and to be lord and master over my hens and geese, every Thursday night,&#039; said the man.<p>&#039;Well, my dear Dragon,&#039; said Reynard, &#039;this is a very hard nut to crack. I can&#039;t get it into my head how you, who are so big and mighty a beast, could find room to lie under yon stone.&#039;<p>&#039;Can&#039;t you,&#039; said the Dragon; &#039;well, I lay under the hillside, and sunned myself, and down came a landslip, and hurled the stone over me.&#039;<p>&#039;All very likely, I dare say,&#039; said Reynard; &#039;but still I can&#039;t understand it, and what&#039;s more, I won&#039;t believe it till I see it.&#039;<p>So the man said they had better prove it, and the Dragon crawled down into the hole again; but in the twinkling of an eye they whipped out the lever, and down the stone crashed again on the Dragon.<p>&#039;Lie now there till Doomsday,&#039; said the fox. &#039;You would eat the man, would you, who saved your life?&#039;<p>The Dragon groaned, and moaned, and begged hard to come out; but the two went their way, and left him alone.<p>The very first Thursday night Reynard came to be lord and master over the hen-roost, and hid himself behind a great pile of wood hard by. When the maid went to feed the fowls, in stole Reynard. She neither saw nor heard anything of him; but her back was scarce turned before he had sucked blood enough for a week, and stuffed himself so that he couldn&#039;t stir. So when she came again in the morning, there Reynard lay and snored, and slept in the morning sun, with all four legs stretched straight; and he was as sleek and round as a German sausage.<p>Away ran the lassie for the goody, and she came, and all the lassies with her, with sticks and brooms to beat Reynard; and, to tell the truth, they nearly banged the life out of him; but, just as it was almost all over with him, and he thought his last hour was come, he found a hole in the floor, and so he crept out, and limped and hobbled off to the wood.<p>&#039;Oh, oh,&#039; said Reynard; &#039;how true it is. &#039;Tis the way of the world; and this is how it pays its debts.&#039;<br>

The Wolf and the Crane
  A WOLF who had a bone stuck in his throat hired a Crane, for a large sum, to put her head into his mouth and draw out the bone.  When the Crane had extracted the bone and demanded the promised payment, the Wolf, grinning and grinding his teeth, exclaimed: &quot;Why, you have surely already had a sufficient recompense, in having been permitted to draw out your head in safety from the mouth and jaws of a wolf.&quot;  In serving the wicked, expect no reward, and be thankful if you escape injury for your pains.

The wolf and the fox
The wolf had the fox with him, and whatsoever the wolf wished, that the fox was compelled to do, for he was the weaker, and he would gladly have been rid of his master. It chanced that once as they were going through the forest, the wolf said, "Red-fox, get me something to eat, or else I will eat thee thyself." Then the fox answered, "I know a farm-yard where there are two young lambs; if thou art inclined, we will fetch one of them." That suited the wolf, and they went thither, and the fox stole the little lamb, took it to the wolf, and went away. The wolf devoured it, but was not satisfied with one; he wanted the other as well, and went to get it. As, however, he did it so awkwardly, the mother of the little lamb heard him, and began to cry out terribly, and to bleat so that the farmer came running there. They found the wolf, and beat him so mercilessly, that he went to the fox limping and howling. "Thou hast misled me finely," said he; "I wanted to fetch the other lamb, and the country folks surprised me, and have beaten me to a jelly." The fox replied, "Why art thou such a glutton?"<p>Next day they again went into the country, and the greedy wolf once more said, "Red-fox, get me something to eat, or I will eat thee thyself." Then answered the fox, "I know a farm-house where the wife is baking pancakes to-night; we will get some of them for ourselves." They went there, and the fox slipped round the house, and peeped and sniffed about until he discovered where the dish was, and then drew down six pancakes and carried them to the wolf. "There is something for thee to eat," said he to him, and then went his way. The wolf swallowed down the pancakes in an instant, and said, "They make one want more," and went thither and tore the whole dish down so that it broke in pieces. This made such a great noise that the woman came out, and when she saw the wolf she called the people, who hurried there, and beat him as long as their sticks would hold together, till with two lame legs, and howling loudly, he got back to the fox in the forest. "How abominably thou hast misled me!" cried he, "the peasants caught me, and tanned my skin for me." But the fox replied, "Why art thou such a glutton?"<p>On the third day, when they were out together, and the wolf could only limp along painfully, he again said, "Red-fox, get me something to eat, or I will eat thee thyself." The fox answered, "I know a man who has been killing, and the salted meat is lying in a barrel in the cellar; we will get that." Said the wolf, "I will go when thou dost, that thou mayest help me if I am not able to get away." - "I am willing," said the fox, and showed him the by-paths and ways by which at length they reached the cellar. There was meat in abundance, and the wolf attacked it instantly and thought, "There is plenty of time before I need leave off!" The fox liked it also, but looked about everywhere, and often ran to the hole by which they had come in, and tried if his body was still thin enough to slip through it. The wolf said, "Dear fox, tell me why thou art running here and there so much, and jumping in and out?"<p>"I must see that no one is coming," replied the crafty fellow. "Don&#039;t eat too much!" Then said the wolf, "I shall not leave until the barrel is empty." In the meantime the farmer, who had heard the noise of the fox&#039;s jumping, came into the cellar. When the fox saw him he was out of the hole at one bound. The wolf wanted to follow him, but he had made himself so fat with eating that he could no longer get through, but stuck fast. Then came the farmer with a cudgel and struck him dead, but the fox bounded into the forest, glad to be rid of the old glutton.

The Wolf and the Housedog
  A WOLF, meeting a big well-fed Mastiff with a wooden collar about his neck asked him who it was that fed him so well and yet compelled him to drag that heavy log about wherever he went.  &quot;The master,&quot; he replied. Then said the Wolf: &quot;May no friend of mine ever be in such a plight; for the weight of this chain is enough to spoil the appetite.&quot;

The wolf and the man
Once on a time the fox was talking to the wolf of the strength of man; how no animal could withstand him, and how all were obliged to employ cunning in order to preserve themselves from him. Then the wolf answered, "If I had but the chance of seeing a man for once, I would set on him notwithstanding." - "I can help thee to do that," said the fox. "Come to me early to-morrow morning, and I will show thee one." The wolf presented himself betimes, and the fox took him out on the road by which the huntsmen went daily. First came an old discharged soldier. "Is that a man?" inquired the wolf. "No," answered the fox, "that was one." Afterwards came a little boy who was going to school. "Is that a man?" - "No, that is going to be one." At length came a hunter with his double-barrelled gun at his back, and hanger by his side. Said the fox to the wolf, "Look, there comes a man, thou must attack him, but I will take myself off to my hole." The wolf then rushed on the man. When the huntsman saw him he said, "It is a pity that I have not loaded with a bullet," aimed, and fired his small shot in his face. The wolf pulled a very wry face, but did not let himself be frightened, and attacked him again, on which the huntsman gave him the second barrel. The wolf swallowed his pain, and rushed on the huntsman, but he drew out his bright hanger, and gave him a few cuts with it right and left, so that, bleeding everywhere, he ran howling back to the fox. "Well, brother wolf," said the fox, "how hast thou got on with man?" - "Ah!" replied the wolf, "I never imagined the strength of man to be what it is! First, he took a stick from his shoulder, and blew into it, and then something flew into my face which tickled me terribly; then he breathed once more into the stick, and it flew into my nose like lightning and hail; when I was quite close, he drew a white rib out of his side, and he beat me so with it that I was all but left lying dead." - "See what a braggart thou art!" said the fox. "Thou throwest thy hatchet so far that thou canst not fetch it back again!"

The Wolf and the Seven Young Kids
There was once an old goat who had seven little ones, and was as fond of them as ever mother was of her children. One day she had to go into the wood to fetch food for them, so she called them all round her. "Dear children," said she, "I am going out into the wood; and while I am gone, be on your guard against the wolf, for if he were once to get inside he would eat you up, skin, bones, and all. The wretch often disguises himself, but he may always be known by his hoarse voice and black paws." - "Dear mother," answered the kids, "you need not be afraid, we will take good care of ourselves." And the mother bleated good-bye, and went on her way with an easy mind.<p>It was not long before some one came knocking at the house-door, and crying out: "Open the door, my dear children, your mother is come back, and has brought each of you something." But the little kids knew it was the wolf by the hoarse voice. "We will not open the door," cried they; "you are not our mother, she has a delicate and sweet voice, and your voice is hoarse; you must be the wolf." Then off went the wolf to a shop and bought a big lump of chalk, and ate it up to make his voice soft. And then he came back, knocked at the house-door, and cried: "Open the door, my dear children, your mother is here, and has brought each of you something." But the wolf had put up his black paws against the window, and the kids seeing this, cried out, "We will not open the door; our mother has no black paws like you; you must be the wolf." The wolf then ran to a baker. "Baker," said he, "I am hurt in the foot; pray spread some dough over the place." And when the baker had plastered his feet, he ran to the miller. "Miller," said he, "strew me some white meal over my paws." But the miller refused, thinking the wolf must be meaning harm to some one. "If you don&#039;t do it," cried the wolf, "I&#039;ll eat you up!" And the miller was afraid and did as he was told. And that just shows what men are.<p>And now came the rogue the third time to the door and knocked. "Open, children!" cried he. "Your dear mother has come home, and brought you each something from the wood." - "First show us your paws," said the kids, "so that we may know if you are really our mother or not." And he put up his paws against the window, and when they saw that they were white, all seemed right, and they opened the door. And when he was inside they saw it was the wolf, and they were terrified and tried to hide themselves. One ran under the table, the second got into the bed, the third into the oven, the fourth in the kitchen, the fifth in the cupboard, the sixth under the sink, the seventh in the clock-case. But the wolf found them all, and gave them short shrift; one after the other he swallowed down, all but the youngest, who was hid in the clock-case. And so the wolf, having got what he wanted, strolled forth into the green meadows, and laying himself down under a tree, he fell asleep.<p>Not long after, the mother goat came back from the wood; and, oh! what a sight met her eyes! the door was standing wide open, table, chairs, and stools, all thrown about, dishes broken, quilt and pillows torn off the bed. She sought her children, they were nowhere to be found. She called to each of them by name, but nobody answered, until she came to the name of the youngest. "Here I am, mother," a little voice cried, "here, in the clock case." And so she helped him out, and heard how the wolf had come, and eaten all the rest. And you may think how she cried for the loss of her dear children.<p>At last in her grief she wandered out of doors, and the youngest kid with her; and when they came into the meadow, there they saw the wolf lying under a tree, and snoring so that the branches shook. The mother goat looked at him carefully on all sides and she noticed how something inside his body was moving and struggling. Dear me! thought she, can it be that my poor children that he devoured for his evening meal are still alive? And she sent the little kid back to the house for a pair of shears, and needle, and thread. Then she cut the wolf&#039;s body open, and no sooner had she made one snip than out came the head of one of the kids, and then another snip, and then one after the other the six little kids all jumped out alive and well, for in his greediness the rogue had swallowed them down whole. How delightful this was! so they comforted their dear mother and hopped about like tailors at a wedding. "Now fetch some good hard stones," said the mother, "and we will fill his body with them, as he lies asleep." And so they fetched some in all haste, and put them inside him, and the mother sewed him up so quickly again that he was none the wiser.<p>When the wolf at last awoke, and got up, the stones inside him made him feel very thirsty, and as he was going to the brook to drink, they struck and rattled one against another. And so he cried out:<p>"What is this I feel inside me<p>Knocking hard against my bones?<p>How should such a thing betide me!<p>They were kids, and now they&#039;re stones." <p>So he came to the brook, and stooped to drink, but the heavy stones weighed him down, so he fell over into the water and was drowned. And when the seven little kids saw it they came up running. "The wolf is dead, the wolf is dead!" they cried, and taking hands, they danced with their mother all about the place.

The Wonderful Musician
There was once a wonderful musician, who went quite alone through a forest and thought of all manner of things, and when nothing was left for him to think about, he said to himself, "Time is beginning to pass heavily with me here in the forest, I will fetch hither a good companion for myself." Then he took his fiddle from his back, and played so that it echoed through the trees. It was not long before a wolf came trotting through the thicket towards him. "Ah, here is a wolf coming! I have no desire for him!" said the musician; but the wolf came nearer and said to him, "Ah, dear musician, how beautifully thou dost play. I should like to learn that, too." - "It is soon learnt," the musician replied, "thou hast only to do all that I bid thee." - "Oh, musician," said the wolf, "I will obey thee as a scholar obeys his master." The musician bade him follow, and when they had gone part of the way together, they came to an old oak-tree which was hollow inside, and cleft in the middle. "Look," said the musician, "if thou wilt learn to fiddle, put thy fore paws into this crevice." The wolf obeyed, but the musician quickly picked up a stone and with one blow wedged his two paws so fast that he was forced to stay there like a prisoner. "Stay there until I come back again," said the musician, and went his way.<p>After a while he again said to himself, "Time is beginning to pass heavily with me here in the forest, I will fetch hither another companion," and took his fiddle and again played in the forest. It was not long before a fox came creeping through the trees towards him. "Ah, there&#039;s a fox coming!" said the musician. "I have no desire for him." The fox came up to him and said, "Oh, dear musician, how beautifully thou dost play! I should like to learn that too." - "That is soon learnt," said the musician. "Thou hast only to do everything that I bid thee." - "Oh, musician," then said the fox, "I will obey thee as a scholar obeys his master." - "Follow me," said the musician; and when they had walked a part of the way, they came to a footpath, with high bushes on both sides of it. There the musician stood still, and from one side bent a young hazel-bush down to the ground, and put his foot on the top of it, then he bent down a young tree from the other side as well, and said, "Now little fox, if thou wilt learn something, give me thy left front paw." The fox obeyed, and the musician fastened his paw to the left bough. "Little fox," said he, "now reach me thy right paw" and he tied it to the right bough. When he had examined whether they were firm enough, he let go, and the bushes sprang up again, and jerked up the little fox, so that it hung struggling in the air. "Wait there till I come back again," said the musician, and went his way.<p>Again he said to himself, "Time is beginning to pass heavily with me here in the forest, I will fetch hither another companion," so he took his fiddle, and the sound echoed through the forest. Then a little hare came springing towards him. "Why, a hare is coming," said the musician, "I do not want him." - "Ah, dear musician," said the hare, "how beautifully thou dost fiddle; I too, should like to learn that." - "That is soon learnt," said the musician, "thou hast only to do everything that I bid thee." - "Oh, musician," replied the little hare, "I will obey thee as a scholar obeys his master." They went a part of the way together until they came to an open space in the forest, where stood an aspen tree. The musician tied a long string round the little hare&#039;s neck, the other end of which he fastened to the tree. "Now briskly, little hare, run twenty times round the tree!" cried the musician, and the little hare obeyed, and when it had run round twenty times, it had twisted the string twenty times round the trunk of the tree, and the little hare was caught, and let it pull and tug as it liked, it only made the string cut into its tender neck. "Wait there till I come back," said the musician, and went onwards.<p>The wolf, in the meantime, had pushed and pulled and bitten at the stone, and had worked so long that he had set his feet at liberty and had drawn them once more out of the cleft. Full of anger and rage he hurried after the musician and wanted to tear him to pieces. When the fox saw him running, he began to lament, and cried with all his might, "Brother wolf, come to my help, the musician has betrayed me!" The wolf drew down the little tree, bit the cord in two, and freed the fox, who went with him to take revenge on the musician. They found the tied-up hare, whom likewise they delivered, and then they all sought the enemy together.<p>The musician had once more played his fiddle as he went on his way, and this time he had been more fortunate. The sound reached the ears of a poor wood-cutter, who instantly, whether he would or no, gave up his work and came with his hatchet under his arm to listen to the music. "At last comes the right companion," said the musician, "for I was seeking a human being, and no wild beast." And he began and played so beautifully and delightfully that the poor man stood there as if bewitched, and his heart leaped with gladness. And as he thus stood, the wolf, the fox, and the hare came up, and he saw well that they had some evil design. So he raised his glittering axe and placed himself before the musician, as if to say, "Whoso wishes to touch him let him beware, for he will have to do with me!" Then the beasts were terrified and ran back into the forest. The musician, however, played once more to the man out of gratitude, and then went onwards.

The Wonderful Musician
THERE was once a wonderful musician, who went quite alone through a forest and thought of all manner of things, and when nothing was left for him to think about, he said to himself, "Time is beginning to pass heavily with me here in the forest, I will fetch hither a good companion for myself." Then he took his fiddle from his back, and played so that it echoed through the trees. It was not long before a wolf came trotting through the thicket towards him. "Ah, here is a wolf coming! I have no desire for him!" said the musician; but the wolf came nearer and said to him, "Ah, dear musician, how beautifully thou dost play! I should like to learn that, too." "It is soon learnt," the musician replied, "thou hast only to do all that I bid thee." "Oh, musician," said the wolf, "I will obey thee as a scholar obeys his master." The musician bade him follow, and when they had gone part of the way together, they came to an old oak-tree which was hollow inside, and cleft in the middle. "Look," said the musician, "if thou wilt learn to fiddle, put thy fore paws into this crevice." The wolf obeyed, but the musician quickly picked up a stone and with one blow wedged his two paws so fast that he was forced to stay there like a prisoner. "Stay there until I come back again," said the musician, and went his way.<br>After a while he again said to himself, "Time is beginning to pass heavily with me here in the forest, I will fetch hither another companion," and took his fiddle and again played in the forest. It was not long before a fox came creeping through the trees towards him. "Ah, there&#039;s a fox coming!" said the musician. "I have no desire for him." The fox came up to him and said, "Oh, dear musician, how beautifully thou dost play! I should like to learn that too." "That is soon learnt," said the musician. "Thou hast only to do everything that I bid thee." "Oh, musician," then said the fox, "I will obey thee as a scholar obeys his master." "Follow me," said the musician; and when they had walked a part of the way, they came to a footpath, with high bushes on both sides of it. There the musician stood still, and from one side bent a young hazel-bush down to the ground, and put his foot on the top of it, then he bent down a young tree from the other side as well, and said, "Now, little fox, if thou wilt learn something, give me thy left front paw." The fox obeyed, and the musician fastened his paw to the left bough. "Little fox," said he, "now reach me thy right paw," and he tied it to the right bough. Then he had examined whether they were firm enough, he let go, and the bushes sprang up again, and jerked up the little fox, so that it hung struggling in the air. "Wait there till I come back again," said the musician, and went his way.<p>Again he said to himself, "Time is beginning to pass heavily with me here in the forest, I will fetch hither another companion," so he took his fiddle, and the sound echoed through the forest. Then a little hare came springing towards him. "Why, a hare is coming," said the musician, "I do not want him." "Ah, dear musician," said the hare, "how beautifully thou dost fiddle; I, too, should like to learn that." "That is soon learnt," said the musician, "thou hast only to do everything that I bid thee."<p>"Oh, musician," replied the little hare, "I will obey thee as a scholar obeys his master." They went a part of the way together until they came to an open space in the forest, where stood an aspen-tree. The musician tied a long string round the little hare&#039;s neck, the other end of which he fastened to the tree. "Now briskly, little hare, run twenty times round the tree!" cried the musician, and the little hare obeyed, and when it had run round twenty times, it had twisted the string twenty times round the trunk of the tree, and the little hare was caught, and let it pull and tug as it liked, it only made the string cut into its tender neck. "Wait there till I come back," said the musician, and went onwards.<p>The wolf, in the meantime, had pushed and pulled and bitten at the stone, and had worked so long that he had set his feet at liberty and had drawn them once more out of the cleft.

Well Done and Ill Paid
ONCE on a time there was a man, who had to drive his sledge to the wood for fuel. So a bear met him.<p>"Out with your horse," said the Bear, "or I&#039;ll strike all your sheep dead by summer."<p>"Oh! heaven help me then," said the man; "there&#039;s not a stick of firewood in the house; you must let me drive home a load of fuel, else we shall be frozen to death. I&#039;ll bring the horse to you to-morrow morning."<p>Yes; on those terms he might drive the wood home, that was a bargain; but Bruin said, "if he didn&#039;t come back, he should lose all his sheep by summer."<p>So the man got the wood on the sledge and rattled homewards, but he wasn&#039;t over pleased at the bargain you may fancy. So just then a fox met him.<p>"Why, what&#039;s the matter?" said the Fox; "why are you so down in the mouth?"<p>"Oh, if you want to know," said the man; "I met a bear up yonder in the wood, and I had to give my word to him to bring Dobbin back to-morrow, at this very hour for if he didn&#039;t get him, he said he would tear all my sheep to death by summer."<p>"Stuff, nothing worse than that," said the Fox; "if you&#039;ll give me your fattest wether, I&#039;ll soon set you free; see if I don&#039;t."<p>Yes; the man gave his word, and swore he would keep it too.<p>"Well, when you come with Dobbin to-morrow for the bear," said the Fox, "I&#039;ll make a clatter up in that heap of stones yonder, and so when the bear asks what that noise is, you must say &#039;tis Peter the Marksman, who is the best shot in the world; and after that you must help yourself."<p>Next day off set the man, and when he met the bear, something began to make a clatter up in the heap of stones.<p>"Hist! what&#039;s that?" said the Bear.<p>"Oh! that&#039;s Peter the Marksman, to be sure," said the man; "he&#039;s the best shot in the world. I know him by his voice."<p>"Have you seen any bears about here, Eric?" shouted out a voice in the wood.<p>"Say No!" said the Bear.<p>"No, I haven&#039;t seen any," said Eric.<p>"What&#039;s that then that stands alongside your sledge?" bawled out the voice in the wood.<p>"Say it&#039;s an old fir-stump," said the Bear.<p>"Oh, it&#039;s only an old fir-stump," said the man.<p>"Such fir-stumps we take in our country and roll them on our sledges," bawled out the voice. "If you can&#039;t do it yourself, I&#039;ll come and help you."<p>"Say you can help yourself, and roll me up on the sledge," said the Bear.<p>"No, thank ye, I can help myself well enough," said the man, and rolled the bear on to the sledge.<p>"Such fir-stumps we always bind fast on our sledges in our part of the world," bawled out the voice; "shall I come and help you?"<p>"Say you can help yourself, and bind me fast. Do." said the Bear.<p>"No, thanks, I can help myself well enough," said the man, who set to binding Bruin fast with all the ropes he had, so that at last the bear couldn&#039;t stir a paw.<p>"Such fir-stumps we always drive our axes into in our part of the world," bawled out the voice; "for then we guide them better going down the steep pitches."<p>"Pretend to drive your axe into me, do now," said the Bear.<p>Then the man took up his axe, and at one blow split the bear&#039;s skull, so that Bruin lay dead in a trice, and so the man and the fox were great friends, and on the best terms. But when they came near the farm, the Fox said,—<p>"I&#039;ve no mind to go right home with you, for I can&#039;t say I like your tykes; so I&#039;ll just wait here, and you can bring the wether to me, but mind and pick out one nice and fat."<p>Yes, the man would be sure to do that, and thanked the fox much for his help. So when he had put up Dobbin, he went across to the sheep-stall.<p>"Whither away, now?" asked his old dame.<p>"Oh!" said the man, "I&#039;m only going to the sheep-stall to fetch a fat wether for that cunning fox who set our Dobbin free. I gave him my word I would."<p>"Wether, indeed," said the old dame; "never a one shall that thief of a fox get. Haven&#039;t we got Dobbin safe, and the bear into the bargain; and as for the fox, I&#039;ll be bound he&#039;s stolen more of our geese than the wether is worth; and even if he hasn&#039;t stolen them, he will. No, no; take a brace of your swiftest hounds in a sack, and slip them loose after him; and then, perhaps, we shall be rid of this robbing Reynard."<p>Well, the man thought that good advice; so he took two fleet red hounds, put them into a sack, and set off with them.<p>"Have you brought the wether?" said the Fox.<p>"Yes, come and take it," said the man, as he untied the sack and let slip the hounds.<p>"HUF!" said the Fox, and gave a great spring; "true it is what the old saw says, &#039;Well done is often ill paid;&#039; and now, too, I see the truth of another saying, &#039;The worst foes are those of one&#039;s own house.&#039; " That was what the Fox said as he ran off, and saw the red foxy hounds at his heels.<br>
