Big Peter and Little Peter 
ONCE on a time there were two brothers, both named Peter, and so the older was called Big Peter, and the younger Little Peter. When his father was dead, Big Peter took him a wife with lots of money, but Little Peter was at home with his mother, and lived on her means till he grew up. So when he was of age he came into his heritage, and then Big Peter said he mustn&#039;t stay any longer in the old house, and eat up his mother&#039;s substance; &#039;twere better he should go out into the world and do something for himself.<p>Yes; Little Peter thought that no bad plan; so he bought himself a fine horse and a load of butter and cheese, and set off to the town; and with the money he got for his goods he bought brandy, and wine, and beer, and as soon as ever he got home again it was one round of holiday-keeping and merry-making; he treated all his old friends and neighbours, and they treated him again; and so he lived in fun and frolic so long as his money lasted. But when his last shilling was spent, and Little Peter hadn&#039;t a penny in his purse, he went back home again to his old mother, and brought nothing with him but a calf. When the spring came he turned out the calf and let it graze on Big Peter&#039;s meadow. Then Big Peter got cross and killed the calf at one blow; but Little Peter, he flayed the calf, and hung the skin up in the bath-room till it was thoroughly dry; then he rolled it up, stuffed it into a sack, and went about the country trying to sell it; but wherever he came, they only laughed at him, and said they had no need of smoked calfskin. So when he had walked on a long way, he came to a farm, and there he turned in and asked for a night&#039;s lodging.<p>"Nay, nay," said the Goody, " I can&#039;t give you lodging, for my husband is up at the shieling on the hill, and I&#039;m alone in the house. You must just try to get shelter at our next neighbour&#039;s; but still if they won&#039;t take you in, you may come back, for you must have a house over your head, come what may."<p>So as Little Peter passed by the parlour window, he saw that there was a priest in there, with whom the Goody was making merry, and she was serving him up ale and brandy, and a great bowl of custard. But just as the priest had sat down to eat and drink, back came the husband, and as soon as ever the Goody heard him in the passage, she was not slow; she took the bowl of custard, and put it under the kitchen grate, and the ale and brandy into the cellar, and as for the priest, she locked him up in a great chest which stood there. All this Little Peter stood outside and saw, and as soon as the husband was well inside, Little Peter went up to the door and asked if he might have a night&#039;s lodging.<p>"Yes, to be sure," said the man, "we&#039;ll take you in;" and so he begged Little Peter to sit down at the table and eat. Yes, Little Peter sat down, and took his calfskin with him, and laid it down at his feet.<p>So, when they had sat a while, Little Peter began to mutter to his skin.<p>"What are you saying now? can&#039;t you hold your tongue?" said Little Peter.<p>"Who is it you&#039;re talking with?" asked the man.<p>"Oh," answered Little Peter, "it&#039;s only a spae-maiden whom I&#039;ve got in my calfskin."<p>"And pray what does she spae?" asked the man again.<p>"Why, she says that no one can say there isn&#039;t a bowl of custard standing under the grate," said Little Peter.<p>"She may spae as much as she pleases," answered the man, "but we haven&#039;t had custards in this house for a year and a day."<p>But Peter begged him only to look, and he did so; and he found the custard-bowl. So they began to make merry with it, but just as they sat and took their ease, Peter muttered something again to the calfskin.<p>"Hush!" he said, "can&#039;t you hold your jaw?"<p>"And pray what does the spae-maiden say now?" asked the man.<p>"Oh, she says no one can say there isn&#039;t brandy and ale standing just under the trap-door which goes down into the cellar," answered Peter.<p>"Well, if she never spaed wrong in her life, she spaes wrong now," said the man. "Brandy and ale! why, I can&#039;t call to mind the day when we had such things in the house!"<p>"Just look," said Peter; and the man did so, and there, sure enough, he found the drink, and you may fancy how merry and jolly he was.<p>"What did you give for that spae-maiden?" said the man, "for I must have her, whatever you ask for her."<p>"She was left me by my father," said Peter, "and so she didn&#039;t cost me much. To tell you the truth, I&#039;ve no great mind to part with her, but, all the same, you may have her, if you&#039;ll let me have, instead of her, that old chest that stands in the parlour yonder."<p>"The chest&#039;s locked and the key lost," screamed the old dame.<p>"Then I&#039;ll take it without the key, that I will," said Peter.<p>And so he and the man soon struck the bargain. Peter got a rope instead of the key, and the man helped him to get the chest up on his back, and then off he stumped with it. So when he had walked a bit he came on to a bridge, and under the bridge ran a river in such a headlong stream, it leapt, and foamed, and made such a roar, that the bridge shook again.<p>"Ah!" said Peter, "that brandy—that brandy! Now I can feel I&#039;ve had a drop too much. What&#039;s the good of my dragging this chest about? If I hadn&#039;t been drunk and mad, I shouldn&#039;t have gone and swopped away my spae-maiden for it. But now this chest shall go out into the river this very minute."<p>And with that he began to untie the rope.<p>"Au! Au! do for God&#039;s sake set me free. The priest&#039;s life is at stake; he it is whom you have got in the chest," screamed out some one inside.<p>"This must be the Deil himself," said Peter, "who wants to make me believe he has turned priest; but whether he makes himself priest or clerk, out he goes into the river."<p>"Oh, no! oh no!" roared out the priest. "The parish priest is at stake. He was on a visit to the Goody for her soul&#039;s health, but her husband is rough and wild, and so she had to hide me in the chest. Here I have a gold watch and a silver watch in my fob; you shall have them both, and eight hundred dollars beside, if you will only let me out."<p>"Nay, nay," said Peter; "is it really your reverence after all?" and with that he took up a stone, and knocked the lid of the chest to pieces. Then the priest got out, and off he set home to his parsonage both fast and light, for he no longer had his watches and money to weigh him down.<p>As for Little Peter, he went home again, and said to Big Peter, "There was a good sale to-day for calfskins at the market."<p>"Why, what did you get for your tattered one, now?" asked Big Peter.<p>"Quite as much as it was worth. I got eight hundred dollars for it, but bigger and stouter calves&#039; skins fetched twice as much," said Little Peter, and showed his dollars.<p>" &#039;Twas well you told me this," answered Big Peter, who went and slaughtered all his kine and calves, and set off on the road to town with their skins and hides. So when he got to the market, and the tanners asked what he wanted for his hides, Big Peter said he must have eight hundred dollars for the small ones, and so on, more and more, for the big ones. But all the folk only laughed and made game of him, and said he oughtn&#039;t to come there; he&#039;d better turn into the madhouse for a better bargain, and so he soon found out how things had gone, and that Little Peter had played himi a trick. But when he got home again he was not very soft-spoken, and he swore and cursed; so help him, if he wouldn&#039;t strike Little Peter dead that very night. All this Little Peter stood and listened to; and so, when he had gone to bed with his mother, and the night had worn on a little, he begged her to change sides with him, for he was well-nigh frozen, he said, and might be &#039;twas warmer next the wall. Yes, she did that, and in a little while came Big Peter with an axe in his hand, and crept up to the bedside, and at one blow chopped off his mother&#039;s head.<p>Next morning, in went Little Peter into Big Peter&#039;s sitting-room.<p>"Heaven better and help you," he said; "you who have chopped our mother&#039;s head off. The Sheriff will not be over-pleased to hear that you pay mother&#039;s dower in this way."<p>Then Big Peter got so afraid, be begged Little Peter, for God&#039;s sake, to say nothing about what he knew. If he would only do that, he should have eight hundred dollars.<p>Well, Little Peter swept up the money; set his mother&#039;s head on her body again; put her on a hand-sledge, and so drew her to market. There he set her up with an apple-basket on each arm, and an apple in each hand. By and by came a skipper walking along; he thought she was an apple-woman, and asked if she had apples to sell, and how many he might have for a penny. But the old woman made no answer. So the skipper asked again. No! she hadn&#039;t a word to say for herself.<p>"How many may I have for a penny?" he bawled the third time, but the old dame sat bolt upright, as though she neither saw him nor heard what he said. Then the skipper flew into such a rage that he gave her one under the ear, and so away rolled her head across the market-place. At that moment, up came Little Peter with a bound; he fell a-weeping and bewailing, and threatened to make the skipper smart for it, for having dealt his old mother her death-blow.<p>"Dear friend, only hold your tongue about what you know," said the skipper, "and you shall have eight hundred dollars."<p>And so they made it up.<p>When Little Peter got home again, he said to Big Peter,—<p>"Old women fetch a fine price at market to-day; I got eight hundred dollars for mother; just look," and so he showed him the money.<p>" &#039;Twas well I came to know this," said Big Peter.<p>Now you must know he had an old stepmother, so he took and killed her out of hand, and strode off to sell her. But when they heard how he went about trying to sell dead bodies, the neighbours were all for handing him over to the Sheriff, and it was as much as he could do to get out of the scrape.<p>When Big Peter got home again, he was so wroth and mad against Little Peter, he threatened to strike him dead there and then; he needn&#039;t hope for mercy, die he must.<p>"Well, well," said Little Peter, "that&#039;s the way we must all trudge, and betwixt to-day and to-morrow there&#039;s only a night to come. But if I must set off now, I&#039;ve only one thing to ask; stuff me into that sack that hangs yonder, and take and toss me into the river."<p>Well, Big Peter had nothing to say against that; he stuffed him into the sack, and set off. But he hadn&#039;t gone far on his way before it came into his mind that he had forgotten something which he must go back to fetch; meanwhile, he set the sack down by the road-side. Just then came a man driving a fine fat flock of sheep,<p>"To Kingdom-come, to Paradise;<br>To Kingdom-come, to Paradise,"<p>roared out Little Peter, who lay inside the sack, and that he kept bawling and bellowing out.<p>"Mayn&#039;t I get leave to go with you?" asked the man who drove the sheep.<p>"Of course you may," said Little Peter. "If you&#039;ll only untie the sack, and creep into it in my stead, you&#039;ll soon get there. As for me, I don&#039;t mind biding here till next time, that I don&#039;t. But you must keep on calling out the words I bawled out, else you&#039;ll not go to the right place."<p>Then the man untied the sack, and got into it in Little Peter&#039;s place: Peter tied the sack up again, and the man began to bawl out,—<p>"To Kingdom-come, to Paradise;<br>To Kingdom-come, to Paradise;"<p>and to that text he stuck.<p>When Peter had got him well into the sack, he wasn&#039;t slow; off he went with the flock of sheep, and soon put a good bit of the road behind him. Meantime, back came Big Peter, took the sack on his shoulders, and bore it across the country to the river, and all the while he went, the drover sat inside bawling out,—<p>"To Kingdom-come, to Paradise;<br>To Kingdom-come, to Paradise;"<p>"Ay, ay," said Big Peter; "try now to find the way for yourself;" and with that he tossed him out into the stream.<p>So when Big Peter had done that, and was going back home, whom should he overtake but his brother, who went along driving the flock of sheep before him. Big Peter could scarce believe his eyes, and asked how Little Peter had got out of the river, and whence the fine flock of sheep came.<p>"Ah!" said Little Peter, "that just was a good brotherly turn you did me when you threw me into the river. I sank right down to the bottom like a stone, and there I just did see flocks of sheep; you&#039;d scarce believe now, that they go about down there by thousands, one flock bigger than the other. And just look here! here are fleeces for you!"<p>"Well," said Big Peter, "I&#039;m very glad you told me."<p>So off he ran home to his old dame; made her come with him to the river; crept into a sack, and bade her make haste to tie it up, and toss him over the bridge.<p>"I&#039;m going after a flock of sheep," he said, "but if I stay too long, and you think I can&#039;t get along with the flock by myself, just jump over and help me; do you hear?"<p>"Well, don&#039;t stay too long," said his wife, "for my heart is set on seeing those sheep."<p>There she stood and waited a while, but then she thought perhaps her husband couldn&#039;t keep the flock well together, and so down she jumped after him.<p>And so Little Peter was rid of them all, and the farm and fields came to him as heir, and horses and cattle too; and, besides, he had money in his pocket to buy milk kine to tether in his byre.<br>

Brides on their trial
There was once a young shepherd who wished much to marry, and was acquainted with three sisters who were all equally pretty, so that it was difficult to him to make a choice, and he could not decide to give the preference to any one of them. Then he asked his mother for advice, and she said, "Invite all three, and set some cheese before them, and watch how they eat it." The youth did so; the first, however, swallowed the cheese with the rind on; the second hastily cut the rind off the cheese, but she cut it so quickly that she left much good cheese with it, and threw that away also; the third peeled the rind off carefully, and cut neither too much nor too little. The shepherd told all this to his mother, who said, "Take the third for thy wife." This he did, and lived contentedly and happily with her.

Choosing a Bride
There was a young herdsman who wanted very much to marry, and was acquainted with three sisters. Each one was just as beautiful as the other, so it was difficult for him to make a choice, and he could not decide to give the preference to any one of them. Then he asked his mother for advice, and she said, "Invite all three, and set some cheese before them, and watch how they cut off a slice."<p>The youth did so. The first one ate the cheese with the rind on. The second one hastily cut the rind off the cheese, but she cut it so quickly that she left much good cheese with it, and threw that away also. The third peeled the rind off carefully, and cut neither too much nor too little. The shepherd told all this to his mother, who said, "Take the third for your wife."<p>This he did, and lived contentedly and happily with her.

Clever Else
There was once a man who had a daughter who was called Clever Else, and when she was grown up, her father said she must be married, and her mother said, "Yes, if we could only find some one that would consent to have." At last one came from a distance, and his name was Hans, and when he proposed to her, he made it a condition that Clever Else should be very careful as well. "Oh," said the father, "she does not want for brains." - "No, indeed," said the mother, "she can see the wind coming up the street and hear the flies cough." - "Well," said Hans, "if she does not turn out to be careful too, I will not have her." Now when they were all seated at table, and had well eaten, the mother said, "Else, go into the cellar and draw some beer." Then Clever Else took down the jug from the hook in the wall, and as she was on her way to the cellar she rattled the lid up and down so as to pass away the time. When she got there, she took a stool and stood it in front of the cask, so that she need not stoop and make her back ache with needless trouble. Then she put the jug under the tap and turned it, and while the beer was running, in order that her eyes should not be idle, she glanced hither and thither, and finally caught sight of a pickaxe that the workmen had left sticking in the ceiling just above her head. Then Clever Else began to cry, for she thought, "If I marry Hans, and we have a child, and it grows big, and we send it into the cellar to draw beer, that pickaxe might fall on his head and kill him." So there she sat and cried with all her might, lamenting the anticipated misfortune. All the while they were waiting upstairs for something to drink, and they waited in vain. At last the mistress said to the maid, "Go down to the cellar and see why Else does not come." So the maid went, and found her sitting in front of the cask crying with all her might. "What are you crying for?" said the maid. "Oh dear me," answered she, "how can I help crying? if I marry Hans, and we have a child, and it grows big, and we send it here to draw beer, perhaps the pickaxe may fall on its head and kill it." - "Our Else is clever indeed!" said the maid, and directly sat down to bewail the anticipated misfortune. After a while, when the people upstairs found that the maid did not return, and they were becoming more and more thirsty, the master said to the boy, "You go down into the cellar, and see what Else and the maid are doing." The boy did so, and there he found both Clever Else and the maid sitting crying together. Then he asked what was the matter. "Oh dear me," said Else, "how can we help crying? If I marry Hans, and we have a child, and it grows big, and we send it here to draw beer, the pickaxe might fall on its head and kill it." - "Our Else is clever indeed!" said the boy, and sitting down beside her, he began howling with a good will. Upstairs they were all waiting for him to come back, but as he did not come, the master said to the mistress, "You go down to the cellar and see what Else is doing." So the mistress went down and found all three in great lamentations, and when she asked the cause, then Else told her how the future possible child might be killed as soon as it was big enough to be sent to draw beer, by the pickaxe falling on it. Then the mother at once exclaimed, "Our Else is clever indeed!" and, sitting down, she wept with the rest. Upstairs the husband waited a little while, but as his wife did not return, and as his thirst constantly increased, he said, "I must go down to the cellar myself, and see what has become of Else." And when he came into the cellar, and found them all sitting and weeping together, he was told that it was all owing to the child that Else might possibly have, and the possibility of its being killed by the pickaxe so happening to fall just at the time the child might be sitting underneath it drawing beer; and when he heard all this, he cried, "How clever is our Else!" and sitting down, he joined his tears to theirs. The intended bridegroom stayed upstairs by himself a long time, but as nobody came back to him, he thought he would go himself and see what they were all about And there he found all five lamenting and crying most pitifully, each one louder than the other. "What misfortune has happened?" cried he. "O my dear Hans," said Else, "if we marry and have a child, and it grows big, and we send it down here to draw beer, perhaps that pickaxe which has been left sticking up there might fall down on the child&#039;s head and kill it; and how can we help crying at that!" - "Now," said Hans, "I cannot think that greater sense than that could be wanted in my household; so as you are so clever, Else, I will have you for my wife," and taking her by the hand he led her upstairs, and they had the wedding at once.<p>A little while after they were married, Hans said to his wife, "I am going out to work, in order to get money; you go into the field and cut the corn, so that we may have bread." - "Very well, I will do so, dear Hans," said she. And after Hans was gone she cooked herself some nice stew, and took it with her into the field. And when she got there, she said to herself, "Now, what shall I do? shall I reap first, or eat first? All right, I will eat first." Then she ate her fill of stew, and when she could eat no more, she said to herself, "Now, what shall I do? shall I reap first, or sleep first? All right, I will sleep first." Then she lay down in the corn and went to sleep. And Hans got home, and waited there a long while, and Else did not come, so he said to himself, "My clever Else is so industrious that she never thinks of coming home and eating." But when evening drew near and still she did not come, Hans set out to see how much corn she had cut; but she had cut no corn at all, but there she was lying in it asleep. Then Hans made haste home, and fetched a bird-net with little bells and threw it over her; and still she went on sleeping. And he ran home again and locked himself in, and sat him down on his bench to work. At last, when it was beginning to grow dark, Clever Else woke, and when she got up and shook herself, the bells jingled at each movement that she made. Then she grew frightened, and began to doubt whether she were really Clever Else or not, and said to herself, "Am I, or am I not?" And, not knowing what answer to make, she stood for a long while considering; at last she thought, "I will go home to Hans and ask him if I am I or not; he is sure to know." So she ran up to the door of her house, but it was locked; then she knocked at the window, and cried, "Hans, is Else within?" - "Yes," answered Hans, "she is in." Then she was in a greater fright than ever, and crying, "Oh dear, then I am not I," she went to inquire at another door, but the people hearing the jingling of the bells would not open to her, and she could get in nowhere. So she ran away beyond the village, and since then no one has seen her.

Clever Grethel
There was once a cook named Grethel, who wore shoes with red rosettes, and when she walked out with them on, she turned herself this way and that, and thought, "You certainly are a pretty girl!" And when she came home she drank, in her gladness of heart, a draught of wine, and as wine excites a desire to eat, she tasted the best of whatever she was cooking until she was satisfied, and said, "The cook must know what the food is like."<p>It came to pass that the master one day said to her, "Grethel, there is a guest coming this evening; prepare me two fowls very daintily." - "I will see to it, master," answered Grethel. She killed two fowls, scalded them, plucked them, put them on the spit, and towards evening set them before the fire, that they might roast. The fowls began to turn brown, and were nearly ready, but the guest had not yet arrived. Then Grethel called out to her master, "If the guest does not come, I must take the fowls away from the fire, but it will be a sin and a shame if they are not eaten directly, when they are juiciest." The master said, "I will run myself, and fetch the guest." When the master had turned his back, Grethel laid the spit with the fowls on one side, and thought, "Standing so long by the fire there, makes one hot and thirsty; who knows when they will come? Meanwhile, I will run into the cellar, and take a drink." She ran down, set a jug, said, "God bless it to thy use, Grethel," and took a good drink, and took yet another hearty draught.<p>Then she went and put the fowls down again to the fire, basted them, and drove the spit merrily round. But as the roast meat smelt so good, Grethel thought, "Something might be wrong, it ought to be tasted!" She touched it with her finger, and said, "Ah! how good fowls are! It certainly is a sin and a shame that they are not eaten directly!" She ran to the window, to see if the master was not coming with his guest, but she saw no one, and went back to the fowls and thought, "One of the wings is burning! I had better take it off and eat it." So she cut it off, ate it, and enjoyed it, and when she had done, she thought, "the other must go down too, or else master will observe that something is missing." When the two wings were eaten, she went and looked for her master, and did not see him. It suddenly occurred to her, "Who knows? They are perhaps not coming at all, and have turned in somewhere." Then she said, "Hallo, Grethel, enjoy yourself, one fowl has been cut into, take another drink, and eat it up entirely; when it is eaten you will have some peace, why should God&#039;s good gifts be spoilt?" So she ran into the cellar again, took an enormous drink and ate up the one chicken in great glee. When one of the chickens was swallowed down, and still her master did not come, Grethel looked at the other and said, "Where one is, the other should be likewise, the two go together; what&#039;s right for the one is right for the other; I think if I were to take another draught it would do me no harm." So she took another hearty drink, and let the second chicken rejoin the first.<p>While she was just in the best of the eating, her master came and cried, hurry up, "Haste thee, Grethel, the guest is coming directly after me!" - "Yes, sir, I will soon serve up," answered Grethel. Meantime the master looked to see that the table was properly laid, and took the great knife, wherewith he was going to carve the chickens, and sharpened it on the steps. Presently the guest came, and knocked politely and courteously at the house-door. Grethel ran, and looked to see who was there, and when she saw the guest, she put her finger to her lips and said, "Hush! hush! get away as quickly as you can, if my master catches you it will be the worse for you; he certainly did ask you to supper, but his intention is to cut off your two ears. Just listen how he is sharpening the knife for it!" The guest heard the sharpening, and hurried down the steps again as fast as he could. Grethel was not idle; she ran screaming to her master, and cried, "You have invited a fine guest!" - "Eh, why, Grethel? What do you mean by that?" - "Yes," said she, "he has taken the chickens which I was just going to serve up, off the dish, and has run away with them!" - "That&#039;s a nice trick!" said her master, and lamented the fine chickens. "If he had but left me one, so that something remained for me to eat." He called to him to stop, but the guest pretended not to hear. Then he ran after him with the knife still in his hand, crying, "Just one, just one," meaning that the guest should leave him just one chicken, and not take both. The guest, however, thought no otherwise than that he was to give up one of his ears, and ran as if fire were burning under him, in order to take them both home with him.

Clever Hans
The mother of Hans said, "Whither away, Hans?" Hans answered, "To Grethel." - "Behave well, Hans." - "Oh, I&#039;ll behave well. Good-bye, mother." - "Good-bye, Hans." Hans comes to Grethel, "Good day, Grethel." - "Good day, Hans. What dost thou bring that is good?" - "I bring nothing, I want to have something given me." Grethel presents Hans with a needle. Hans says, "Good-bye, Grethel." - "Good-bye, Hans."<p>Hans takes the needle, sticks it into a hay-cart, and follows the cart home. "Good evening, mother." - "Good evening, Hans. Where hast thou been?" - "With Grethel." - "What didst thou take her?" - "Took nothing; had something given me." - "What did Grethel give thee?" - "Gave me a needle." - "Where is the needle, Hans?" - "Stuck it in the hay-cart." - "That was ill done, Hans. Thou shouldst have stuck the needle in thy sleeve." - "Never mind, I&#039;ll do better next time."<p>"Whither away, Hans?" - "To Grethel, mother." - "Behave well, Hans." - "Oh, I&#039;ll behave well. Good-bye, mother." - "Good-bye, Hans."<p>Hans comes to Grethel. "Good day, Grethel." - "Good day, Hans. What dost thou bring that is good?" - "I bring nothing; I want to have something given to me." Grethel presents Hans with a knife. "Good-bye, Grethel." - "Good-bye Hans." Hans takes the knife, sticks it in his sleeve, and goes home. "Good evening, mother." - "Good evening, Hans. Where hast thou been?" - "With Grethel." - "What didst thou take her?" - "Took her nothing, she gave me something." - "What did Grethel give thee?" - "Gave me a knife." - "Where is the knife, Hans?" - "Stuck in my sleeve." - "That&#039;s ill done, Hans, thou shouldst have put the knife in thy pocket." - "Never mind, will do better next time." - "Whither away, Hans?" - "To Grethel, mother. " - "Behave well, Hans." - "Oh, I&#039;ll behave well. Good-bye, mother." - "Good-bye, Hans."<p>Hans comes to Grethel. "Good day, Grethel." - "Good day, Hans. What good thing dost thou bring?" - "I bring nothing, I want something given me." Grethel presents Hans with a young goat. "Good-bye, Grethel." - "Good-bye, Hans." Hans takes the goat, ties its legs, and puts it in his pocket. When he gets home it is suffocated. "Good evening, mother." - "Good evening, Hans. Where hast thou been?" - "With Grethel." - "What didst thou take her?" - "Took nothing, she gave me something." - "What did Grethel give thee?" - "She gave me a goat." - "Where is the goat, Hans?" - "Put it in my pocket." - "That was ill done, Hans, thou shouldst have put a rope round the goat&#039;s neck." - "Never mind, will do better next time."<p>"Whither away, Hans,?" - "To Grethel, mother." - "Behave well, Hans." - "Oh, I&#039;ll behave well. Good-bye, mother." - "Good-bye, Hans." Hans comes to Grethel. "Good day, Grethel." - "Good day, Hans. What good thing dost thou bring?" - "I bring nothing, I want something given me." Grethel presents Hans with a piece of bacon. "Good-bye, Grethel." - "Good-bye, Hans."<p>Hans takes the bacon, ties it to a rope, and drags it away behind him. The dogs come and devour the bacon. When he gets home, he has the rope in his hand, and there is no longer anything hanging to it. "Good evening, mother." - "Good evening, Hans." - "Where hast thou been?" - "With Grethel." What didst thou take her?" - "I took her nothing, she gave me something." - "What did Grethel give thee?" - "Gave me a bit of bacon." - "Where is the bacon, Hans?" - "I tied it to a rope, brought it home, dogs took it." - "That was ill done, Hans, thou shouldst have carried the bacon on thy head." - "Never mind, will do better next time." - "Whither away, Hans?" - "To Grethel, mother." - "Behave well, Hans." - "I&#039;ll behave well. Good-bye, mother." - "Good-bye, Hans."<p>Hans comes to Grethel. "Good day, Grethel." - "Good day, Hans." - "What good thing dost thou bring?" - "I bring nothing, but would have something given." Grethel presents Hans with a calf. "Good-bye, Grethel." - "Good-bye, Hans."<p>Hans takes the calf, puts it on his head, and the calf kicks his face. Good evening, mother." - "Good evening, Hans. Where hast thou been?" - "With Grethel." - "What didst thou take her?" - "I took nothing, but had something given me." - "What did Grethel give thee?" - "A calf." - "Where hast thou the calf, Hans?" - "I set it on my head and it kicked my face." - "That was ill done, Hans, thou shouldst have led the calf, and put it in the stall." - "Never mind, will do better next time."<p>"Whither away, Hans?" - "To Grethel, mother." - "Behave well, Hans." - "I&#039;ll behave well. Good-bye, mother." - "Good-bye, Hans."<p>Hans comes to Grethel. "Good day, Grethel." - "Good day, Hans. What good thing dost thou bring?" - "I bring nothing, but would have something given." Grethel says to Hans, "I will go with thee."<p>Hans takes Grethel, ties her to a rope, leads her to the rack and binds her fast. Then Hans goes to his mother. "Good evening, mother." - "Good evening, Hans. Where hast thou been?" - "With Grethel." - "What didst thou take her?" - "I took her nothing." - "What did Grethel give thee?" - "She gave me nothing, she came with me." - "Where hast thou left Grethel?" - "I led her by the rope, tied her to the rack, and scattered some grass for her." - "That was ill done, Hans, thou shouldst have cast friendly eyes on her." - "Never mind, will do better."<p>Hans went into the stable, cut out all the calves&#039;, and sheep&#039;s eyes, and threw them in Grethel&#039;s face. Then Grethel became angry, tore herself loose and ran away, and became the bride of Hans.

Doctor Know-all
There was once on a time a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with two oxen a load of wood to the town, and sold it to a doctor for two thalers. When the money was being counted out to him, it so happened that the doctor was sitting at table, and when the peasant saw how daintily he ate and drank, his heart desired what he saw, and he would willingly have been a doctor too. So he remained standing a while, and at length inquired if he too could not be a doctor. "Oh, yes," said the doctor, "that is soon managed." - "What must I do?" asked the peasant. "In the first place buy thyself an A B C book of the kind which has a cock on the frontispiece: in the second, turn thy cart and thy two oxen into money, and get thyself some clothes, and whatsoever else pertains to medicine; thirdly, have a sign painted for thyself with the words, "I am Doctor Knowall," and have that nailed up above thy house-door." The peasant did everything that he had been told to do. When he had doctored people awhile, but not long, a rich and great lord had some money stolen. Then he was told about Doctor Knowall who lived in such and such a village, and must know what had become of the money. So the lord had the horses put in his carriage, drove out to the village, and asked Crabb if he were Doctor Knowall? Yes, he was, he said. Then he was to go with him and bring back the stolen money. "Oh, yes, but Grethe, my wife, must go too." The lord was willing and let both of them have a seat in the carriage, and they all drove away together. When they came to the nobleman&#039;s castle, the table was spread, and Crabb was told to sit down and eat. "Yes, but my wife, Grethe, too," said he, and he seated himself with her at the table. And when the first servant came with a dish of delicate fare, the peasant nudged his wife, and said, "Grethe, that was the first," meaning that was the servant who brought the first dish. The servant, however, thought he intended by that to say, "That is the first thief," and as he actually was so, he was terrified, and said to his comrade outside, "The doctor knows all: we shall fare ill, he said I was the first." The second did not want to go in at all, but was forced. So when he went in with his dish, the peasant nudged his wife, and said, "Grethe, that is the second." This servant was just as much alarmed, and he got out. The third did not fare better, for the peasant again said, "Grethe, that is the third." The fourth had to carry in a dish that was covered, and the lord told the doctor that he was to show his skill, and guess what was beneath the cover. The doctor looked at the dish, had no idea what to say, and cried, "Ah, poor Crabb." When the lord heard that, he cried, "There! he knows it, he knows who has the money!"<p>On this the servants looked terribly uneasy, and made a sign to the doctor that they wished him to step outside for a moment. When therefore he went out, all four of them confessed to him that they had stolen the money, and said that they would willingly restore it and give him a heavy sum into the bargain, if he would not denounce them, for if he did they would be hanged. They led him to the spot where the money was concealed. With this the doctor was satisfied, and returned to the hall, sat down to the table, and said, "My lord, now will I search in my book where the gold is hidden." The fifth servant, however, crept into the stove to hear if the doctor knew still more. The Doctor, however, sat still and opened his A B C book, turned the pages backwards and forwards, and looked for the cock. As he could not find it immediately he said, "I know you are there, so you had better show yourself." Then the fellow in the stove thought that the doctor meant him, and full of terror, sprang out, crying, "That man knows everything!" Then Dr. Knowall showed the count where the money was, but did not say who had stolen it, and received from both sides much money in reward, and became a renowned man.

Domestic servants
"Whither goest thou?" - "To Walpe." - "I to Walpe, thou to Walpe, so, so, together we&#039;ll go."<p>"Hast thou a man? What is his name?" - "Cham." - "My man Cham, thy man Cham; I to Walpe, thou to Walpe; so, so, together we&#039;ll go."<p>"Hast thou a child? How is he styled?" - "Wild." - "My child Wild, thy child Wild; my man Cham, thy man Cham; I to Walpe, thou to Walpe, so, so, together we&#039;ll go."<p>"Hast thou a cradle? How callest thou thy cradle?" - "Hippodadle." - "My cradle Hippodadle, my child Wild, thy child Wild, my man Cham, thy man Cham; I to Walpe, thou to Walpe, so, so, together we&#039;ll go."<p>"Hast thou also a drudge? What name has thy drudge?" - "From-thy-work- do-not-budge." - "My drudge, From-thy-work-do-not-budge; my child Wild, thy child Wild; my man Cham, thy man Cham; I to Walpe, thou to Walpe; so, so, together we&#039;ll go."

Frederick and Catherine
There was once on a time a man who was called Frederick and a woman called Catherine, who had married each other and lived together as young married folks. One day Frederick said, "I will now go and plough, Catherine; when I come back, there must be some roast meat on the table for hunger, and a fresh draught for thirst." - "Just go, Frederick," answered Kate, "just go, I will have all ready for you." Therefore when dinner-time drew near she got a sausage out of the chimney, put it in the frying-pan, put some butter to it, and set it on the fire. The sausage began to fry and to hiss, Catherine stood beside it and held the handle of the pan, and had her own thoughts as she was doing it. Then it occurred to her, "While the sausage is getting done thou couldst go into the cellar and draw beer." So she set the frying-pan safely on the fire, took a can, and went down into the cellar to draw beer. The beer ran into the can and Kate watched it, and then she thought, "Oh, dear! The dog upstairs is not fastened up, it might get the sausage out of the pan. Well thought of." And in a trice she was up the cellar-steps again, but the Spitz had the sausage in its mouth already, and trailed it away on the ground. But Catherine, who was not idle, set out after it, and chased it a long way into the field; the dog, however, was swifter than Catherine and did not let the sausage journey easily, but skipped over the furrows with it. "What&#039;s gone is gone!" said Kate, and turned round, and as she had run till she was weary, she walked quietly and comfortably, and cooled herself. During this time the beer was still running out of the cask, for Kate had not turned the tap. And when the can was full and there was no other place for it, it ran into the cellar and did not stop until the whole cask was empty. As soon as Kate was on the steps she saw the mischance. "Good gracious!" she cried. "What shall I do now to stop Frederick knowing it!" She thought for a while, and at last she remembered that up in the garret was still standing a sack of the finest wheat flour from the last fair, and she would fetch that down and strew it over the beer. "Yes," said she, "he who saves a thing when he ought, has it afterwards when he needs it," and she climbed up to the garret and carried the sack below, and threw it straight down on the can of beer, which she knocked over, and Frederick&#039;s draught swam also in the cellar. "It is all right," said Kate, "where the one is the other ought to be also," and she strewed the meal over the whole cellar. When it was done she was heartily delighted with her work, and said, "How clean and wholesome it does look here!"<p>At mid-day home came Frederick: "Now, wife, what have you ready for me?" - "Ah, Freddy," she answered, "I was frying a sausage for you, but whilst I was drawing the beer to drink with it, the dog took it away out of the pan, and whilst I was running after the dog, all the beer ran out, and whilst I was drying up the beer with the flour, I knocked over the can as well, but be easy, the cellar is quite dry again." Said Frederick, "Kate, Kate, you should not have done that! to let the sausage be carried off and the beer run out of the cask, and throw out all our flour into the bargain!" - "Indeed, Frederick, I did not know that, you should have told me."<p>The man thought, "If my wife is like this, I must look after things more." Now he had got together a good number of thalers which he changed into gold, and said to Catherine, "Look, these are counters for playing games; I will put them in a pot and bury them in the stable under the cow&#039;s manger, but mind you keep away from them, or it will be the worse for you." Said she, "Oh, no, Frederick, I certainly will not go." And when Frederick was gone some pedlars came into the village who had cheap earthen-bowls and pots, and asked the young woman if there was nothing she wanted to bargain with them for? "Oh, dear people," said Catherine, "I have no money and can buy nothing, but if you have any use for yellow counters I will buy of you." - "Yellow counters, why not? But just let us see them." - "Then go into the stable and dig under the cow&#039;s manger, and you will find the yellow counters. I am not allowed to go there." The rogues went thither, dug and found pure gold. Then they laid hold of it, ran away, and left their pots and bowls behind in the house. Catherine though she must use her new things, and as she had no lack in the kitchen already without these, she knocked the bottom out of every pot, and set them all as ornaments on the paling which went round about the house. When Frederick came and saw the new decorations, he said, "Catherine, what have you been about?" - "I have bought them, Frederick, for the counters which were under the cow&#039;s manger. I did not go there myself, the pedlars had to dig them out for themselves." - "Ah, wife," said Frederick, "what have you done? Those were not counters, but pure gold, and all our wealth; you should not have done that." - "Indeed, Frederick," said she, "I did not know that, you should have forewarned me."<p>Catherine stood for a while and bethought to herself; then she said, "Listen, Frederick, we will soon get the gold back again, we will run after the thieves." - "Come, then," said Frederick, "we will try it; but take with you some butter and cheese that we may have something to eat on the way." - "Yes, Frederick, I will take them." They set out, and as Frederick was the better walker, Catherine followed him. "It is to my advantage," thought she, "when we turn back I shall be a little way in advance." Then she came to a hill where there were deep ruts on both sides of the road. "There one can see," said Catherine, "how they have torn and skinned and galled the poor earth, it will never be whole again as long as it lives," and in her heart&#039;s compassion she took her butter and smeared the ruts right and left, that they might not be so hurt by the wheels, and as she was thus bending down in her charity, one of the cheeses rolled out of her pocket down the hill. Said Catherine, "I have made my way once up here, I will not go down again; another may run and fetch it back." So she took another cheese and rolled it down. But the cheeses did not come back, so she let a third run down, thinking. "Perhaps they are waiting for company, and do not like to walk alone." As all three stayed away she said, "I do not know what that can mean, but it may perhaps be that the third has not found the way, and has gone wrong, I will just send the fourth to call it." But the fourth did no better than the third. Then Catherine was angry, and threw down the fifth and sixth as well, and these were her last. She remained standing for some time watching for their coming, but when they still did not come, she said, "Oh, you are good folks to send in search of death, you stay a fine long time away! Do you think I will wait any longer for you? I shall go my way, you may run after me; you have younger legs than I." Catherine went on and found Frederick, who was standing waiting for her because he wanted something to eat. "Now just let us have what you have brought with you," said he. She gave him the dry bread. "Where have you the butter and the cheeses?" asked the man. "Ah, Freddy," said Catherine, "I smeared the cart-ruts with the butter and the cheeses will come soon; one ran away from me, so I sent the others after to call it." Said Frederick, "You should not have done that, Catherine, to smear the butter on the road, and let the cheeses run down the hill!" - "Really, Frederick, you should have told me."<p>Then they ate the dry bread together, and Frederick said, "Catherine, did you make the house safe when you came away?" - "No, Frederick, you should have told me to do it before." - "Then go home again, and make the house safe before we go any farther, and bring with you something else to eat. I will wait here for you." Catherine went back and thought, "Frederick wants something more to eat, he does not like butter and cheese, so I will take with me a handkerchief full of dried pears and a pitcher of vinegar for him to drink." Then she bolted the upper half of the door fast, but unhinged the lower door, and took it on her back, believing that when she had placed the door in security the house must be well taken care of. Catherine took her time on the way, and thought, "Frederick will rest himself so much the longer." When she had once reached him she said, "Here is the house-door for you, Frederick, and now you can take care of the house yourself." - "Oh, heavens," said he, "what a wise wife I have! She takes the under-door off the hinges that everything may run in, and bolts the upper one. It is now too late to go back home again, but since you have brought the door here, you shall just carry it farther." - "I will carry the door, Frederick, but the dried pears and the vinegar-jug will be too heavy for me, I will hang them on the door, it may carry them."<p>And now they went into the forest, and sought the rogues, but did not find them. At length as it grew dark they climbed into a tree and resolved to spend the night there. Scarcely, however, had they sat down at the top of it than the rascals came thither who carry away with them what does not want to go, and find things before they are lost. They sat down under the very tree in which Frederick and Catherine were sitting, lighted a fire, and were about to share their booty. Frederick got down on the other side and collected some stones together. Then he climbed up again with them, and wished to throw them at the thieves and kill them. The stones, however, did not hit them, and the knaves cried, "It will soon be morning, the wind is shaking down the fir-apples. Catherine still had the door on her back, and as it pressed so heavily on her, she thought it was the fault of the dried pears, and said, "Frederick, I must throw the pears down." - "No, Catherine, not now," he replied, "they might betray us." - "Oh, but, Frederick, I must! They weigh me down far too much." - "Do it, then, and be hanged!" Then the dried pears rolled down between the branches, and the rascals below said, "The leaves are falling." A short time afterwards, as the door was still heavy, Catherine said, "Ah, Frederick, I must pour out the vinegar." - "No, Catherine, you must not, it might betray us." - "Ah, but, Frederick, I must, it weighs me down far too much." - "Then do it and be hanged!" So she emptied out the vinegar, and it besprinkled the robbers. They said amongst themselves, "The dew is already falling." At length Catherine thought, "Can it really be the door which weighs me down so?" and said, "Frederick, I must throw the door down." - "No, not now, Catherine, it might discover us." - "Oh, but, Frederick, I must. It weighs me down far too much." - "Oh, no, Catherine, do hold it fast." - "Ah, Frederick, I am letting it fall!" - "Let it go, then, in the devil&#039;s name." Then it fell down with a violent clatter, and the rascals below cried, "The devil is coming down the tree!" and they ran away and left everything behind them. Early next morning, when the two came down they found all their gold again, and carried it home.<p>When they were once more at home, Frederick said, "And now, Catherine, you, too, must be industrious and work." - "Yes, Frederick, I will soon do that, I will go into the field and cut corn." When Catherine got into the field, she said to herself, "Shall I eat before I cut, or shall I sleep before I cut? Oh, I will eat first." Then Catherine ate and eating made her sleepy, and she began to cut, and half in a dream cut all her clothes to pieces, her apron, her gown, and her shift. When Catherine awoke again after a long sleep she was standing there half-naked, and said to herself, "Is it I, or is it not I? Alas, it is not I." In the meantime night came, and Catherine ran into the village, knocked at her husband&#039;s window, and cried, "Frederick." - "What is the matter?" - "I should very much like to know if Catherine is in?" - "Yes, yes," replied Frederick, "she must be in and asleep." Said she, "&#039;Tis well, then I am certainly at home already," and ran away.<p>Outside Catherine found some vagabonds who were going to steal. Then she went to them and said, "I will help you to steal." The rascals thought that she knew the situation of the place, and were willing. Catherine went in front of the houses, and cried, "Good folks, have you anything? We want to steal." The thieves thought to themselves, "That&#039;s a fine way of doing things," and wished themselves once more rid of Catherine. Then they said to her, "Outside the village the pastor has some turnips in the field. Go there and pull up some turnips for us." Catherine went to the ground, and began to pull them up, but was so idle that she did not gather them together. Then a man came by, saw her, and stood still and thought that it was the devil who was thus rooting amongst the turnips. He ran away into the village to the pastor, and said, "Mr. Pastor, the devil is in your turnip-ground, rooting up turnips." - "Ah, heavens," answered the pastor, "I have a lame foot, I cannot go out and drive him away." Said the man, "Then I will carry you on my back," and he carried him out on his back. And when they came to the ground, Catherine arose and stood up her full height. "Ah, the devil!" cried the pastor, and both hurried away, and in his great fright the pastor could run better with his lame foot than the man who had carried him on his back could do with his sound one.

Going a-travelling
There was once a poor woman who had a son, who much wished to travel, but his mother said, "How canst thou travel? We have no money at all for thee to take away with thee." Then said the son, "I will manage very well for myself; I will always say, &#039;Not much, not much, not much.&#039;"<p>So he walked for a long time and always said, "Not much, not much, not much." Then he passed by a company of fishermen and said, "God speed you! not much, not much, not much." - "What sayst thou churl, not much?" And when the net was drawn out they had not caught much fish. So one of them fell on the youth with a stick and said, "Hast thou never seen me threshing?" - "What ought I to say, then?" asked the youth. "Thou must say, &#039;Get it full, get it full.&#039;"<p>After this he again walked a long time, and said, "Get it full, get it full," until he came to the gallows, where they had got a poor sinner whom they were about to hang. Then said he, "Good morning; get it full, get it full." - "What sayst thou, knave, get it full? Dost thou want to make out that there are still more wicked people in the world is not this enough?" And he again got some blows on his back. "What am I to say, then?" said he. "Thou must say, &#039;May God have pity on the poor soul.&#039;"<p>Again the youth walked on for a long while and said, "May God have pity on the poor soul!" Then he came to a pit by which stood a knacker who was cutting up a horse. The youth said, "Good morning; God have pity on the poor soul!" - "What dost thou say, thou ill-tempered knave?" and the knacker gave him such a box on the ear, that he could not see out of his eyes. "What am I to say, then?" - "Thou must say, &#039;There lies the carrion in the pit!&#039;"<p>So he walked on, and always said, "There lies the carrion in the pit, there lies the carrion in the pit." And he came to a cart full of people, so he said, "Good morning, there lies the carrion in the pit!" Then the cart pushed him into a hole, and the driver took his whip and cracked it upon the youth, till he was forced to crawl back to his mother, and as long as he lived he never went out a-travelling again.

Goody Gainst-the-stream
Once on a time there was a man who had a goody who was so cross-grained that there was no living with her. As for her husband he could not get on with her at all, for whatever he wished she set her face right against it.<br>So it fell one Sunday in summer that the man and his wife went out into the field to see how the crop looked; and when they came to a field of rye on the other side of the river, the man said--<p>&#039;Ay! now it is ripe. To-morrow we must set to work and reap it.&#039;<p>&#039;Yes,&#039; said his wife, &#039;to-morrow we can set to work and shear it.&#039;<p>&#039;What do you say,&#039; said the man; &#039;shall we shear it? Mayn&#039;t we just as well reap it?&#039;<p>&#039;No,&#039; said the goody, &#039;It shall be shorn.&#039;<p>&#039;There is nothing so bad as a little knowledge,&#039; said the man, &#039;but you must have lost the little wit you had. When did you ever hear of shearing a field?&#039;<p>&#039;I know little, and I care to know little, I dare say,&#039; said the goody, &#039;but I know very well that this field shall be shorn and not reaped.&#039;<p>That was what she said, and there was no help for it; it must and should be shorn.<p>So they walked about and quarrelled and strove till they came to the bridge across the river, just above a deep hole.<p>&#039;&#039;Tis an old saying,&#039; said the man, &#039;that good tools make good work, but I fancy it will be a fine swathe that is shorn with a pair of shears. Mayn&#039;t we just as well reap the field after all?&#039; he asked.<p>&#039;No! no! shear, shear,&#039; bawled out the goody, who jumped about and clipped like a pair of scissors under her husband&#039;s nose. In her shrewishness she took such little heed that she tripped over a beam on the bridge, and down she went plump into the stream.<p>&#039;&#039;Tis hard to wean any one from bad ways,&#039; said the man, &#039;but it were strange if I were not sometimes in the right, I too.&#039;<p>Then he swam out into the hole and caught his wife by the hair of her head, and so got her head above water.<p>&#039;Shall we reap the field now?&#039; were the first words he said.<p>&#039;Shear! shear! shear!&#039; screeched the goody.<p>&#039;I&#039;ll teach you to shear,&#039; said the man, as he ducked her under the water; but it was no good, they must shear it, she said, as soon as ever she came up again.<p>&#039;I can&#039;t think anything else than that the goody is mad,&#039; said the man to himself. &#039;Many are mad and never know it; many have wit and never show it; but all the same, I&#039;ll try her once more.&#039;<p>But as soon as ever he ducked her under the water again, she held her hands up out of the water and began to clip with her fingers like a pair of shears. Then the man fell into a great rage and ducked her down both well and long; but while he was about it, the goody&#039;s head fell down below the water, and she got so heavy all at once, that he had to let her go.<p>&#039;No! no!&#039; he said, &#039;you wish to drag me down with you into the hole, but you may lie there by yourself.&#039;<p>So the goody was left in the river.<p>But after a while the man thought it was ill she should lie there and not get Christian burial, and so he went down the course of the stream and hunted and searched for her, but for all his pains he could not find her. Then he came with all his men and brought his neighbours with him, and they all in a body began to drag the stream and to search for her all along it. But for all their searching they found no goody.<p>&#039;Oh!&#039; said the man, &#039;I have it. All this is no good, we search in the wrong place. This goody was a sort by herself; there was not such another in the world while she was alive. She was so cross and contrary, and I&#039;ll be bound it is just the same now she is dead. We had better just go and hunt for her up stream, and drag for her above the force, maybe she has floated up thither.&#039;<p>And so it was. They went up stream and sought for her above the force, and there lay the goody, sure enough! Yes! She was well called GOODY GAINST-THE-STREAM.<br>

Goosey Grizzel
ONCE on a time there was a Widower, who had a house keeper named Grizzel, who set her mutch at him, and teazed him early and late to marry her. At last the man got so weary of her he was at his wit&#039;s end to know how to get rid of her.<p>So it fell on a day, between hay time and harvest, the two went out to pull hemp. Grizzel&#039;s head was full of her good looks and her handiness, and she worked away at the hemp till she grew giddy from the strong smell of the ripe seed, and at last down she fell flat, fast asleep among the hemp. While she slept, her master got a pair of scissors and cut her skirts short all round, and then he rubbed her all over, face and all, first with tallow and then with soot, till she looked worse than the Deil himself. So, when Grizzel woke and saw how ugly she was, she didn&#039;t know herself.<p>"Can this be me, now?" said Grizzel, "Nay, nay! it can never be me. So ugly have I never been; it&#039;s surely the Deil himself?"<p>Well! that she might really know the truth, she went off and knocked at her master&#039;s door, and asked,—<p>"Is your Girzie at home the day, father?"<p>"Ay, ay, our Girzie is at home safe enough," said the man, who wanted to be rid of her.<p>"Well, well!" she said to herself, "then I can&#039;t be his Grizzel," and stole away; and right glad the man was, I can tell you.<p>So, when she had walked a bit she came to a great wood, where she met two thieves. "The very men for my money," thought Grizzel, "since I am the Deil thieves are just fit fellows for me."<p>But the thieves were not of the same mind, not they. As soon as they set eyes on her they took to their heels as fast as they could, for they thought the Evil One was come to catch them. But it was no good, for Grizzel was long-legged and swift-footed, and she came up with them before they knew where they were.<p>"If you&#039;re going out to steal, I&#039;ll go with you and help," said Grizzel, "for I know the whole country round." So, when the thieves heard that, they thought they had found a good mate, and were no longer afraid.<p>Then they said they were off to steal a sheep, only they didn&#039;t know where to lay hold of one.<p>"Oh!" said Grizzel, "that&#039;s a small matter, for I was maid with a farmer ever so long out in the wood yonder, and I could find the sheepfold though the night were dark as pitch."<p>The thieves thought that grand; and when they came to the place, Grizzel was to go into the fold and turn out the sheep, and they were to lay hold on it. Now, the sheepfold lay close to the wall of the room where the farmer slept, so Grizzel crept quite softly and carefully into the fold; but as soon as she got in she began to scream out to the thieves.<p>"Will you have a wether or a ewe? here are lots to choose from."<p>"Hush, hush!" said the thieves, "only take one that is fine and fat."<p>"Yes, yes! but will you have a wether or a ewe? will you have a wether or a ewe? for here are lots to choose from," screeched Grizzel.<p>"Hush, hush!" said the thieves again, "only take one that&#039;s fine and fat; it&#039;s all the same to us whether it&#039;s a wether or a ewe."<p>"Yes!" screeched Grizzel, who stuck to her own; "but will you have a wether or a ewe—a wether or a ewe? here are lots to choose from."<p>"Hold your jaw!" said the thieves, "and take a fine fat one, wether or ewe, it&#039;s all one to us."<p>But just then out came the farmer in his shirt, who had been waked by all this clatter, and wanted to see what was going on. So the thieves took to their heels, and Grizzel after them, upsetting the farmer in her flight.<p>"Stop, boys! stop, boys!" she screamed; but the farmer, who had only seen the black monster, grew so afraid that he could scarce stand, for he thought it was the Deil himself that had been in his sheepfold. The only help he knew was to go indoors and wake up the whole house; and they all sat down to read and pray, for he had heard that was the way to send the Deil about his business.<p>Now the next night the thieves said they must go and steal a fat goose, and Grizzel was to show them the way. So when they came to the goosepen, Grizzel was to go in and turn one out, for she knew the ways of the place, and the thieves were to stand outside and catch it. But as soon as ever she got in she began to scream,—<p>"Will you have goose or gander? you may pick and choose here."<p>"Hush, hush! choose only a fine fat one," said the thieves.<p>"Yes, yes! but will you have goose or gander—goose or gander? you may pick and choose," screamed Grizzel.<p>"Hush, hush! only choose one that&#039;s fine and fat, and it&#039;s all one to us whether it&#039;s goose or gander; but do hold your jaw," said they.<p>But while Grizzel and the thieves were settling this, one of the geese began to cackle, and then another cackled, and then the whole flock cackled and hissed, and out came the farmer to see what all the noise could mean, and away went the thieves, and Grizzel after them at full speed, and the farmer thought again it was the black Deil flying away; for long-legged she was, and she had no skirts to hamper her.<p>"Stop a bit, boys!" she kept on screaming, "you might as well have said whether you would have goose or gander."<p>But they had no time to stop, they thought; and, as for the farmer, he began to read and pray with all his house, small and great, for they thought it was the Deil, and no mistake.<p>Now, the third day, when night came, the thieves and Grizzel were so hungry they did not know what to do; so they made up their minds to go to the larder of a rich farmer who lived by the wood&#039;s side, and steal some food. Well, off they went, but the thieves did not dare to venture themselves, so Grizzel was to go up the steps which led to the larder, and hand the food out, and the others were to stand below and take it from her. So when Grizzel got inside she saw the larder was full of all sorts of things, fresh meat and salt, and sausages and oat-cake. The thieves begged her to be still, and just throw out something to eat, and to bear in mind how badly they had fared for two nights. But Grizzel stuck to her own, that she did.<p>"Will you have fresh meat or salt, or sausages, or oat-cake? Just look, what lovely oat-cake," she bawled out enough to split your head. "You may have what you please, for here&#039;s plenty to choose from."<p>But the farmer woke with all this noise, and ran out to see what it all meant. As for the thieves, off they ran as fast as they could; but while the farmer was looking after them down came Grizzel so black and ugly.<p>"Stop a bit! stop a bit, boys!" she bellowed; "you may have what you please, for there&#039;s plenty to choose from."<p>And when the farmer saw that ugly monster he too thought the Deil was loose, for he had heard what had happened to his neighbours the evenings before; so he began both to read and pray, and every one in the whole parish began to read and pray, for they knew that you could read the Devil away.<p>The next evening was Saturday evening, and the thieves wanted to steal a fat ram for their Sunday dinner; and well they might, for they had fasted many days, but they wouldn&#039;t have Grizzel with them at any price. She brought bad luck with her jaw, they said; so while Grizzel was walking about waiting for them on Sunday morning, she got so awfully hungry—for she had fasted for three days—that she went into a turnip field and pulled up some turnips to eat. But when the farmer who owned the turnips rose, he felt uneasy in his mind, and thought he would just go and take a look at his turnips on the Sunday morning. So he pulled on his trousers and went across the moss which lay under the hill, where the turnip-field lay. But when he got to the bottom of the field he saw something black walking about in the field and pulling up his turnips, and he soon made up his mind that it was the Deil. So away he ran home as fast as he could, and said the Deil was among the turnips. This frightened the whole house out of their wits, and they agreed they&#039;d best send for the priest, and get him to bind the Deil.<p>"That won&#039;t do," said the goodwife; "this is Sunday morning, you&#039;ll never get the priest to come; for either he&#039;ll be in bed, or, if he&#039;s up, he&#039;ll be learning his sermon by heart."<p>"Oh," said the goodman, "never fear; I&#039;ll promise him a fat loin of veal, and then he&#039;ll come fast enough."<p>So off he went to the priest&#039;s house; but when he got there sure enough the priest was still in bed. The maid begged the farmer to walk into the parlour while she ran up to the priest, and said,—<p>"Farmer So-and-So was down-stairs, and wished to have a word with him."<p>Well, when the priest heard that such a worthy man was down-stairs, he got up at once, and came down just as he was, in his slippers and night-cap.<p>So the goodman told his errand; how the Deil was loose in his turnip-field; and if the priest would only come and bind him, he would send him a fat loin of veal. Yes; the priest was willing enough, and called out to his groom to saddle his horse, while he dressed himself.<p>"Nay, nay, father!" said the man; "the Deil won&#039;t wait for us long, and no one knows where we shall find him again if we miss him now. Your reverence must come, at once, just as you are."<p>So the priest followed him just as he was, with the clothes he stood in, and went off in his nightcap and slippers. But when they got to the moss it was so moist, the priest couldn&#039;t cross it in his slippers. So the goodman took him on his back to carry him over. On they went, the goodman picking his way from one clump to the other, till they got to the middle; then Grizzel caught sight of them, and thought it was the thieves bringing the ram.<p>"Is he fat?" she screamed; "is he fat?" and made such a noise that the wood rang again.<p>"The Deil knows if he&#039;s fat or lean; I&#039;m sure I don&#039;t," said the goodman, when he heard that; "but, if you want to know, you had better come yourself and see."<p>And then he got so afraid he threw the priest head over heels into the soft wet moss, and took to his legs; and if the priest hasn&#039;t got out, why I daresay he&#039;s lying there still.<br>

Gudbrand on the Hill-side
ONCE on a time there was a man whose name was Gudbrand; he had a farm which lay far, far away, upon a hill-side, and so they called him Gudbrand on the Hill-side.<p>Now, you must know this man and his goodwife lived so happily together, and understood one another so well, that all the husband did the wife thought so well done, there was nothing like it in the world, and she was always glad whatever he turned his hand to. The farm was their own land, and they had a hundred dollars lying at the bottom of their chest, and two cows tethered up in a stall in their farmyard.<p>So one day his wife said to Gudbrand,—<p>"Do you know, dear, I think we ought to take one of our cows into town and sell it; that&#039;s what I think; for then we shall have some money in hand, and such well to-do people as we ought to have ready money like the rest of the world. As for the hundred dollars at the bottom of the chest yonder, we can&#039;t make a hole in them, and I&#039;m sure I don&#039;t know what we want with more than one cow. Besides, we shall gain a little in another way, for then I shall get off with only looking after one cow, instead of having, as now, to feed and litter and water two."<p>Well, Gudbrand thought his wife talked right good sense, so he set off at once with the cow on his way to town to sell her; but when he got to the town, there was no one who would buy his cow.<p>"Well, well! never mind," said Gudbrand, "at the worst, I can only go back home again with my cow. I&#039;ve both stable and tether for her, I should think, and the road is no farther out than in;" and with that he began to toddle home with his cow.<p>But when he had gone a bit of the way, a man met him who had a horse to sell, so Gudbrand thought &#039;twas better to have a horse than a cow, so he swopped with the man. A little farther on he met a man walking along and driving a fat pig before him, and he thought it better to have a fat pig than a horse, so he swopped with the man. After that he went a little farther, and a man met him with a goat; so he thought it better to have a goat than a pig, and he swopped with the man that owned the goat. Then he went on a good bit till he met a man who had a sheep, and he swopped with him too, for he thought it always better to have a sheep than a goat. After a while he met a man with a goose, and he swopped away the sheep for the goose; and when he had walked a long, long time, he met a man with a cock, and he swopped with him, for he thought in this wise, " &#039;Tis surely better to have a cock than a goose." Then he went on till the day was far spent, and he began to get very hungry, so he sold the cock for a shilling, and bought food with the money, for, thought Gudbrand on the Hill-side, " &#039;Tis always better to save one&#039;s life than to have a cock."<p>After that he went on home till he reached his nearest neighbour&#039;s house, where he turned in.<p>"Well," said the owner of the house, "how did things go with you in town?"<p>"Rather so so," said Gudbrand. "I can&#039;t praise my luck, nor do I blame it either," and with that he told the whole story from first to last.<p>"Ah!" said his friend, "you&#039;ll get nicely called over the coals, that one can see, when you get home to your wife. Heaven help you, I wouldn&#039;t stand in your shoes for something."<p>"Well," said Gudbrand on the Hill-side, "I think things might have gone much worse with me; but now, whether I have done wrong or not, I have so kind a good-wife, she never has a word to say against anything that I do."<p>"Oh!" answered his neighbour, "I hear what you say, but I don&#039;t believe it for all that."<p>"Shall we lay a bet upon it?" asked Gudbrand on the Hill-side. "I have a hundred dollars at the bottom of my chest at home; will you lay as many against them?"<p>Yes, the friend was ready to bet; so Gudbrand stayed there till evening, when it began to get dark, and then they went together to his house, and the neighbour was to stand outside the door and listen, while the man went in to see his wife.<p>"Good evening!" said Gudbrand on the Hill-side.<p>"Good evening!" said the goodwife. "Oh, is that you? now God be praised."<p>Yes! it was he. So the wife asked how things had gone with him in town.<p>"Oh! only so so," answered Gudbrand; "not much to brag of. When I got to the town there was no one who would buy the cow, so you must know I swopped it away for a horse."<p>"For a horse," said his wife; "well, that is good of you; thanks with all my heart. We are so well to do that we may drive to church, just as well as other people; and if we choose to keep a horse we have a right to get one, I should think. So run out, child, and put up the horse."<p>"Ah!" said Gudbrand, "but you see I&#039;ve not got the horse after all; for when I got a bit farther on the road I swopped it away for a pig."<p>"Think of that, now!" said the wife; "you did just as I should have done myself; a thousand thanks! Now I can have a bit of bacon in the house to set before people when they come to see me, that I can. What do we want with a horse? People would only say we had got so proud that we couldn&#039;t walk to church. Go out, child, and put up the pig in the stye."<p>"But I&#039;ve not got the pig either," said Gudbrand; "for when I got a little farther on I swopped it away for a milch goat."<p>"Bless us!" cried his wife, "how well you manage everything! Now I think it over, what should I do with a pig? People would only point at us and say, &#039;Yonder they eat up all they have got.&#039; No! now I have got a goat, and I shall have milk and cheese, and keep the goat too. Run out, child, and put up the goat."<p>"Nay, but I haven&#039;t got the goat either," said Gudbrand, "for a little farther on I swopped it away, and got a fine sheep instead."<p>"You don&#039;t say so!" cried his wife; "why, you do everything to please me, just as if I had been with you; what do we want with a goat! If I had it I should lose half my time in climbing up the hills to get it down. No! if I have a sheep, I shall have both wool and clothing, and fresh meat in the house. Run out, child, and put up the sheep."<p>"But I haven&#039;t got the sheep any more than the rest," said Gudbrand; "for when I had gone a bit farther I swopped it away for a goose."<p>"Thank you! thank you! with all my heart," cried his wife; "what should I do with a sheep? I have no spinning-wheel, nor carding-comb, nor should I care to worry myself with cutting, and shaping, and sewing clothes. We can buy clothes now, as we have always done; and now I shall have roast goose, which I have longed for so often; and, besides, down to stuff my little pillow with. Run out, child, and put up the goose."<p>"Ah!" said Gudbrand, "but I haven&#039;t the goose either; for when I had gone a bit farther I swopped it away for a cock."<p>"Dear me!" cried his wife, "how you think of everything! just as I should have done myself. A cock! think of that! why it&#039;s as good as an eight-day clock, for every morning the cock crows at four o&#039;clock, and we shall be able to stir our stumps in good time. What should we do with a goose? I don&#039;t know how to cook it; and as for my pillow, I can stuff it with cotton-grass. Run out, child, and put up the cock."<p>"But after all I haven&#039;t got the cock," said Gudbrand; "for when I had gone a bit farther, I got as hungry as a hunter, so I was forced to sell the cock for a shilling, for fear I should starve."<p>"Now, God be praised that you did so!" cried his wife; "whatever you do, you do it always just after my own heart. What should we do with the cock? We are our own masters, I should think, and can lie a-bed in the morning, as long as we like. Heaven be thanked that I have got you safe back again; you who do everything so well that I want neither cock nor goose; neither pigs nor kine."<p>Then Gudbrand opened the door and said,—<p>"Well, what do you say now? Have I won the hundred dollars?" and his neighbour was forced to allow that he had.<br>

Hans in luck
Hans had served his master for seven years, so he said to him, "Master, my time is up; now I should be glad to go back home to my mother; give me my wages." The master answered, "You have served me faithfully and honestly; as the service was so shall the reward be;" and he gave Hans a piece of gold as big as his head. Hans pulled his handkerchief out of his pocket, wrapped up the lump in it, put it on his shoulder, and set out on the way home.<p>As he went on, always putting one foot before the other, he saw a horseman trotting quickly and merrily by on a lively horse. "Ah!" said Hans quite loud, "what a fine thing it is to ride! There you sit as on a chair; you stumble over no stones, you save your shoes, and get on, you don&#039;t know how."<p>The rider, who had heard him, stopped and called out, "Hollo! Hans, why do you go on foot, then?"<p>"I must," answered he, "for I have this lump to carry home; it is true that it is gold, but I cannot hold my head straight for it, and it hurts my shoulder."<p>"I will tell you what," said the rider, "we will exchange: I will give you my horse, and you can give me your lump."<p>"With all my heart," said Hans, "but I can tell you, you will have to crawl along with it."<p>The rider got down, took the gold, and helped Hans up; then gave him the bridle tight in his hands and said, "If you want to go at a really good pace, you must click your tongue and call out, "Jup! Jup!"<p>Hans was heartily delighted as he sat upon the horse and rode away so bold and free. After a little while he thought that it ought to go faster, and he began to click with his tongue and call out, "Jup! Jup!" The horse put himself into a sharp trot, and before Hans knew where he was, he was thrown off and lying in a ditch which separated the field from the highway. The horse would have gone off too if it had not been stopped by a countryman, who was coming along the road and driving a cow before him.<p>Hans got his limbs together and stood up on his legs again, but he was vexed, and said to the countryman, "It is a poor joke, this riding, especially when one gets hold of a mare like this, that kicks and throws one off, so that one has a chance of breaking one&#039;s neck. Never again will I mount it. Now I like your cow, for one can walk quietly behind her, and have, over and above, one&#039;s milk, butter and cheese every day without fail. What would I not give to have such a cow." - "Well," said the countryman, "if it would give you so much pleasure, I do not mind giving the cow for the horse." Hans agreed with the greatest delight; the countryman jumped upon the horse, and rode quickly away.<p>Hans drove his cow quietly before him, and thought over his lucky bargain. "If only I have a morsel of bread -- and that can hardly fail me -- I can eat butter and cheese with it as often as I like; if I am thirsty, I can milk my cow and drink the milk. Good heart, what more can I want?"<p>When he came to an inn he made a halt, and in his great content ate up what he had with him -- his dinner and supper -- and all he had, and with his last few farthings had half a glass of beer. Then he drove his cow onwards along the road to his mother&#039;s village.<p>As it drew nearer mid-day, the heat was more oppressive, and Hans found himself upon a moor which it took about an hour to cross. He felt it very hot and his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth with thirst. "I can find a cure for this," thought Hans; "I will milk the cow now and refresh myself with the milk." He tied her to a withered tree, and as he had no pail he put his leather cap underneath; but try as he would, not a drop of milk came. And as he set himself to work in a clumsy way, the impatient beast at last gave him such a blow on his head with its hind foot, that he fell on the ground, and for a long time could not think where he was.<p>By good fortune a butcher just then came along the road with a wheel-barrow, in which lay a young pig. "What sort of a trick is this?" cried he, and helped the good Hans up. Hans told him what had happened. The butcher gave him his flask and said, "Take a drink and refresh yourself. The cow will certainly give no milk, it is an old beast; at the best it is only fit for the plough, or for the butcher." - "Well, well," said Hans, as he stroked his hair down on his head, "who would have thought it? Certainly it is a fine thing when one can kill a beast like that at home; what meat one has! But I do not care much for beef, it is not juicy enough for me. A young pig like that now is the thing to have, it tastes quite different; and then there are the sausages!"<p>"Hark ye, Hans," said the butcher, "out of love for you I will exchange, and will let you have the pig for the cow." - "Heaven repay you for your kindness!" said Hans as he gave up the cow, whilst the pig was unbound from the barrow, and the cord by which it was tied was put in his hand.<p>Hans went on, and thought to himself how everything was going just as he wished; if he did meet with any vexation it was immediately set right. Presently there joined him a lad who was carrying a fine white goose under his arm. They said good morning to each other, and Hans began to tell of his good luck, and how he had always made such good bargains. The boy told him that he was taking the goose to a christening-feast. "Just lift her," added he, and laid hold of her by the wings; "how heavy she is -- she has been fattened up for the last eight weeks. Whoever has a bit of her when she is roasted will have to wipe the fat from both sides of his mouth." - "Yes," said Hans, as he weighed her in one hand, "she is a good weight, but my pig is no bad one."<p>Meanwhile the lad looked suspiciously from one side to the other, and shook his head. "Look here," he said at length, "it may not be all right with your pig. In the village through which I passed, the Mayor himself had just had one stolen out of its sty. I fear -- I fear that you have got hold of it there. They have sent out some people and it would be a bad business if they caught you with the pig; at the very least, you would be shut up in the dark hole."<p>The good Hans was terrified. "Goodness!" he said, "help me out of this fix; you know more about this place than I do, take my pig and leave me your goose." - "I shall risk something at that game," answered the lad, "but I will not be the cause of your getting into trouble." So he took the cord in his hand, and drove away the pig quickly along a by-path.<p>The good Hans, free from care, went homewards with the goose under his arm. "When I think over it properly," said he to himself, "I have even gained by the exchange; first there is the good roast-meat, then the quantity of fat which will drip from it, and which will give me dripping for my bread for a quarter of a year, and lastly the beautiful white feathers; I will have my pillow stuffed with them, and then indeed I shall go to sleep without rocking. How glad my mother will be!"<p>As he was going through the last village, there stood a scissors-grinder with his barrow; as his wheel whirred he sang -- <p>"I sharpen scissors and quickly grind,<p>My coat blows out in the wind behind." <p>Hans stood still and looked at him; at last he spoke to him and said, "All&#039;s well with you, as you are so merry with your grinding." - "Yes," answered the scissors-grinder, "the trade has a golden foundation. A real grinder is a man who as often as he puts his hand into his pocket finds gold in it. But where did you buy that fine goose?"<p>"I did not buy it, but exchanged my pig for it."<p>"And the pig?"<p>"That I got for a cow."<p>"And the cow?"<p>"I took that instead of a horse."<p>"And the horse?"<p>"For that I gave a lump of gold as big as my head."<p>"And the gold?"<p>"Well, that was my wages for seven years&#039; service."<p>"You have known how to look after yourself each time," said the grinder. "If you can only get on so far as to hear the money jingle in your pocket whenever you stand up, you will have made your fortune."<p>"How shall I manage that?" said Hans. "You must be a grinder, as I am; nothing particular is wanted for it but a grindstone, the rest finds itself. I have one here; it is certainly a little worn, but you need not give me anything for it but your goose; will you do it?"<p>"How can you ask?" answered Hans. "I shall be the luckiest fellow on earth; if I have money whenever I put my hand in my pocket, what need I trouble about any longer?" and he handed him the goose and received the grindstone in exchange. "Now," said the grinder, as he took up an ordinary heavy stone that lay by him, "here is a strong stone for you into the bargain; you can hammer well upon it, and straighten your old nails. Take it with you and keep it carefully."<p>Hans loaded himself with the stones, and went on with a contented heart; his eyes shone with joy. "I must have been born with a caul," he cried; "everything I want happens to me just as if I were a Sunday-child."<p>Meanwhile, as he had been on his legs since daybreak, he began to feel tired. Hunger also tormented him, for in his joy at the bargain by which he got the cow he had eaten up all his store of food at once. At last he could only go on with great trouble, and was forced to stop every minute; the stones, too, weighed him down dreadfully. Then he could not help thinking how nice it would be if he had not to carry them just then.<p>He crept like a snail to a well in a field, and there he thought that he would rest and refresh himself with a cool draught of water, but in order that he might not injure the stones in sitting down, he laid them carefully by his side on the edge of the well. Then he sat down on it, and was to stoop and drink, when he made a slip, pushed against the stones, and both of them fell into the water. When Hans saw them with his own eyes sinking to the bottom, he jumped for joy, and then knelt down, and with tears in his eyes thanked God for having shown him this favour also, and delivered him in so good a way, and without his having any need to reproach himself, from those heavy stones which had been the only things that troubled him.<p>"There is no man under the sun so fortunate as I," he cried out. With a light heart and free from every burden he now ran on until he was with his mother at home.

How One Went Out to Woo
Once on a time there was a lad who went out to woo him a wife. Amongst other places he came to a farm-house, where the household were little better than beggars; but when the wooer came in they wanted to make out that they were well to do, as you may guess. Now the husband had got a new arm to his coat.<p>"Pray, take a seat," he said to the wooer; "but there&#039;s a shocking dust in the house."<p>So he went about rubbing and wiping all the benches and tables with his new arm, but he kept the other all the while behind his back.<p>The wife she had got one new shoe, and she went stamping and sliding with it up against the stools and chairs, saying, "How untidy it is here! Everything is out of its place!"<p>Then they called out to their daughter to come down and put things to rights; but the daughter she had got a new cap; so she put her head in at the door, and kept nodding and nodding, first to this side, and then to that.<p>"Well! for my part," she said, "I can&#039;t be everywhere at once."<p>Ay! ay! that was a well-to-do household the wooer had come to.<br>

Knoist and his three sons
Between Werrel and Soist there lived a man whose name was Knoist, and he had three sons. One was blind, the other lame, and the third stark-naked. Once on a time they went into a field, and there they saw a hare. The blind one shot it, the lame one caught it, the naked one put it in his pocket. Then they came to a mighty big lake, on which there were three boats, one sailed, one sank, the third had no bottom to it. They all three got into the one with no bottom to it. Then they came to a mighty big forest in which there was a mighty big tree; in the tree was a mighty big chapel in the chapel was a sexton made of beech-wood and a box-wood parson, who dealt out holy-water with cudgels.<p>"How truly happy is that one<p>Who can from holy water run!"

Lazy Harry
Harry was lazy, and although he had nothing else to do but drive his goat daily to pasture, he nevertheless groaned when he went home after his day&#039;s work was done. "It is indeed a heavy burden," said he, "and a wearisome employment to drive a goat into the field this way year after year, till late into the autumn! If one could but lie down and sleep, but no, one must have one&#039;s eyes open lest it hurts the young trees, or squeezes itself through the hedge into a garden, or runs away altogether. How can one have any rest, or peace of one&#039;s life?" He seated himself, collected his thoughts, and considered how he could set his shoulders free from this burden. For a long time all thinking was to no purpose, but suddenly it was as if scales fell from his eyes. "I know what I will do," he cried, "I will marry fat Trina who has also a goat, and can take mine out with hers, and then I shall have no more need to trouble myself."<p>So Harry got up, set his weary legs in motion, and went right across the street, for it was no farther, to where the parents of fat Trina lived, and asked for their industrious and virtuous daughter in marriage. The parents did not reflect long. "Birds of a feather, flock together," they thought, and consented.<p>So fat Trina became Harry&#039;s wife, and led out both the goats. Harry had a good time of it, and had no work that he required to rest from but his own idleness. He only went out with her now and then, and said, "I merely do it that I may afterwards enjoy rest more, otherwise one loses all feeling for it."<p>But fat Trina was no less idle. "Dear Harry," said she one day, "why should we make our lives so toilsome when there is no need for it, and thus ruin the best days of our youth? Would it not be better for us to give the two goats which disturb us every morning in our sweetest sleep with their bleating, to our neighbor, and he will give us a beehive for them. We will put the beehive in a sunny place behind the house, and trouble ourselves no more about it. Bees do not require to be taken care of, or driven into the field; they fly out and find the way home again for themselves, and collect honey without giving the very least trouble." - "Thou hast spoken like a sensible woman," replied Harry. "We will carry out thy proposal without delay, and besides all that, honey tastes better and nourishes one better than goat&#039;s milk, and it can be kept longer too."<p>The neighbor willingly gave a beehive for the two goats. The bees flew in and out from early morning till late evening without ever tiring, and filled the hive with the most beautiful honey, so that in autumn Harry was able to take a whole pitcherful out of it.<p>They placed the jug on a board which was fixed to the wall of their bed-room, and as they were afraid that it might be stolen from them, or that the mice might find it, Trina brought in a stout hazel-stick and put it beside her bed, so that without unnecessary getting up she might reach it with her hand, and drive away the uninvited guests. Lazy Harry did not like to leave his bed before noon. "He who rises early," said he, "wastes his substance." <p>One morning when he was still lying amongst the feathers in broad daylight, resting after his long sleep, he said to his wife, "Women are fond of sweet things, and thou art always tasting the honey in private; it will be better for us to exchange it for a goose with a young gosling, before thou eatest up the whole of it." - "But," answered Trina, "not before we have a child to take care of them! Am I to worry myself with the little geese, and spend all my strength on them to no purpose." - "Dost thou think," said Harry, "that the youngster will look after geese? Now-a-days children no longer obey, they do according to their own fancy, because they consider themselves cleverer than their parents, just like that lad who was sent to seek the cow and chased three blackbirds." - "Oh," replied Trina, "this one shall fare badly if he does not do what I say! I will take a stick and belabour his skin for him with more blows than I can count. Look, Harry," cried she in her zeal, and seized the stick which she had to drive the mice away with, "Look, this is the way I will fall on him!" She reached her arm out to strike, but unhappily hit the honey-pitcher above the bed. The pitcher struck against the wall and fell down in fragments, and the fine honey streamed down on the ground. "There lie the goose and the young gosling," said Harry, "and want no looking after. But it is lucky that the pitcher did not fall on my head. We have all reason to be satisfied with our lot." And then as he saw that there was still some honey in one of the fragments he stretched out his hand for it, and said quite gaily, "The remains, my wife, we will still eat with a relish, and we will rest a little after the fright we have had. What matters if we do get up a little later the day is always long enough." - "Yes," answered Trina, "we shall always get to the end of it at the proper time. Dost thou know that the snail was once asked to a wedding and set out to go, but arrived at the christening. In front of the house it fell over the fence, and said, &#039;Speed does no good.&#039;"

Lean Lisa
was of a very different way of thinking from lazy Harry and fat Trina, who never let anything disturb their peace. She scoured everything with ashes, from morning till evening, and burdened her husband, Long Laurence, with so much work that he had heavier weights to carry than an ass with three sacks. It was, however, all to no purpose, they had nothing and came to nothing. One night as she lay in bed, and could hardly move one limb for weariness, she still did not allow her thoughts to go to sleep. She thrust her elbows into her husband&#039;s side, and said, "Listen, Lenz, to what I have been thinking: if I were to find one florin and one was given to me, I would borrow another to put to them, and thou too shouldst give me another, and then as soon as I had got the four florins together, I would buy a young cow." This pleased the husband right well. "It is true," said he, "that I do not know where I am to get the florin which thou wantest as a gift from me; but, if thou canst get the money together, and canst buy a cow with it, thou wilt do well to carry out thy project. I shall be glad," he added, "if the cow has a calf, and then I shall often get a drink of milk to refresh me." - "The milk is not for thee," said the woman, "we must let the calf suck that it may become big and fat, and we may be able to sell it well." - "Certainly," replied the man, "but still we will take a little milk; that will do no harm." - "Who has taught thee to manage cows?" said the woman; "Whether it does harm or not, I will not allow it, and even if thou wert to stand on thy head for it, thou shouldst not have a drop of the milk! Dost thou think, because there is no satisfying thee, Long Laurence, that thou art to eat up what I earn with so much difficulty?" - "Wife," said the man, "be quiet, or I will give thee a blow on thy mouth!" - "What!" cried she, "thou threatenest me, thou glutton, thou rascal, thou lazy Harry!" She was just laying hold of his hair, but long Laurence got up, seized both Lean Lisa&#039;s withered arms in one hand, and with the other he pressed down her head into the pillow, let her scold, and held her until she fell asleep for very weariness. Whether she continued to wrangle when she awoke next morning, or whether she went out to look for the florin which she wanted to find, that I know not.

Little Claus and big Claus
In a village there once lived two men who had the same name. They were both called Claus. One of them had four horses, but the other had only one; so to distinguish them, people called the owner of the four horses, "Great Claus," and he who had only one, "Little Claus." Now we shall hear what happened to them, for this is a true story.<p>Through the whole week, Little Claus was obliged to plough for Great Claus, and lend him his one horse; and once a week, on a Sunday, Great Claus lent him all his four horses. Then how Little Claus would smack his whip over all five horses, they were as good as his own on that one day. The sun shone brightly, and the church bells were ringing merrily as the people passed by, dressed in their best clothes, with their prayer-books under their arms. They were going to hear the clergyman preach. They looked at Little Claus ploughing with his five horses, and he was so proud that he smacked his whip, and said, "Gee-up, my five horses."<p>"You must not say that," said Big Claus; "for only one of them belongs to you."<p>But Little Claus soon forgot what he ought to say, and when any one passed he would call out, "Gee-up, my five horses!"<p>"Now I must beg you not to say that again," said Big Claus; "for if you do, I shall hit your horse on the head, so that he will drop dead on the spot, and there will be an end of him."<p>"I promise you I will not say it any more," said the other; but as soon as people came by, nodding to him, and wishing him "Good day," he became so pleased, and thought how grand it looked to have five horses ploughing in his field, that he cried out again, "Gee-up, all my horses!"<p>"I&#039;ll gee-up your horses for you," said Big Claus; and seizing a hammer, he struck the one horse of Little Claus on the head, and he fell dead instantly.<p>"Oh, now I have no horse at all," said Little Claus, weeping. But after a while he took off the dead horse&#039;s skin, and hung the hide to dry in the wind. Then he put the dry skin into a bag, and, placing it over his shoulder, went out into the next town to sell the horse&#039;s skin.<p>He had a very long way to go, and had to pass through a dark, gloomy forest. Presently a storm arose, and he lost his way, and before he discovered the right path, evening came on, and it was still a long way to the town, and too far to return home before night.<p>Near the road stood a large farmhouse. The shutters outside the windows were closed, but lights shone through the crevices at the top. "I might get permission to stay here for the night," thought Little Claus; so he went up to the door and knocked.<p>The farmer&#039;s wife opened the door; but when she heard what he wanted, she told him to go away, as her husband would not allow her to admit strangers.<p>"Then I shall be obliged to lie out here," said Little Claus to himself, as the farmer&#039;s wife shut the door in his face.<p>Near to the farmhouse stood a large haystack, and between it and the house was a small shed, with a thatched roof.<p>"I can lie up there," said Little Claus, as he saw the roof; "it will make a famous bed, but I hope the stork will not fly down and bite my legs;" for on it stood a living stork, whose nest was in the roof.<p>So Little Claus climbed to the roof of the shed, and while he turned himself to get comfortable, he discovered that the wooden shutters, which were closed, did not reach to the tops of the windows of the farmhouse, so that he could see into a room, in which a large table was laid out with wine, roast meat, and a splendid fish. The farmer&#039;s wife and the sexton were sitting at the table together; and she filled his glass, and helped him plenteously to fish, which appeared to be his favorite dish.<p>"If I could only get some, too," thought Little Claus; and then, as he stretched his neck towards the window he spied a large, beautiful pie,– indeed they had a glorious feast before them.<p>At this moment he heard some one riding down the road, towards the farmhouse. It was the farmer returning home.<p>He was a good man, but still he had a very strange prejudice,– he could not bear the sight of a sexton. If one appeared before him, he would put himself in a terrible rage. In consequence of this dislike, the sexton had gone to visit the farmer&#039;s wife during her husband&#039;s absence from home, and the good woman had placed before him the best she had in the house to eat. When she heard the farmer coming she was frightened, and begged the sexton to hide himself in a large empty chest that stood in the room. He did so, for he knew her husband could not endure the sight of a sexton. The woman then quickly put away the wine, and hid all the rest of the nice things in the oven; for if her husband had seen them he would have asked what they were brought out for.<p>"Oh, dear," sighed Little Claus from the top of the shed, as he saw all the good things disappear.<p>"Is any one up there?" asked the farmer, looking up and discovering Little Claus. "Why are you lying up there? Come down, and come into the house with me."<p>So Little Claus came down and told the farmer how he had lost his way and begged for a night&#039;s lodging.<p>"All right," said the farmer; "but we must have something to eat first."<p>The woman received them both very kindly, laid the cloth on a large table, and placed before them a dish of porridge. The farmer was very hungry, and ate his porridge with a good appetite, but Little Claus could not help thinking of the nice roast meat, fish and pies, which he knew were in the oven.<p>Under the table, at his feet, lay the sack containing the horse&#039;s skin, which he intended to sell at the next town. Now Little Claus did not relish the porridge at all, so he trod with his foot on the sack under the table, and the dry skin squeaked quite loud.<p>"Hush!" said Little Claus to his sack, at the same time treading upon it again, till it squeaked louder than before.<p>"Hallo! what have you got in your sack!" asked the farmer.<p>"Oh, it is a conjuror," said Little Claus; "and he says we need not eat porridge, for he has conjured the oven full of roast meat, fish, and pie."<p>"Wonderful!" cried the farmer, starting up and opening the oven door; and there lay all the nice things hidden by the farmer&#039;s wife, but which he supposed had been conjured there by the wizard under the table. The woman dared not say anything; so she placed the things before them, and they both ate of the fish, the meat, and the pastry. Then Little Claus trod again upon his sack, and it squeaked as before.<p>"What does he say now?" asked the farmer.<p>"He says," replied Little Claus, "that there are three bottles of wine for us, standing in the corner, by the oven." So the woman was obliged to bring out the wine also, which she had hidden, and the farmer drank it till he became quite merry. He would have liked such a conjuror as Little Claus carried in his sack.<p>"Could he conjure up the evil one?" asked the farmer. "I should like to see him now, while I am so merry."<p>"Oh, yes!" replied Little Claus, "my conjuror can do anything I ask him,– can you not?" he asked, treading at the same time on the sack till it squeaked. "Do you hear? he answers &#039;Yes,&#039; but he fears that we shall not like to look at him."<p>"Oh, I am not afraid. What will he be like?"<p>"Well, he is very much like a sexton."<p>"Ha!" said the farmer, "then he must be ugly. Do you know I cannot endure the sight of a sexton. However, that doesn&#039;t matter, I shall know who it is; so I shall not mind. Now then, I have got up my courage, but don&#039;t let him come too near me."<p>"Stop, I must ask the conjuror," said Little Claus; so he trod on the bag, and stooped his ear down to listen.<p>"What does he say?"<p>"He says that you must go and open that large chest which stands in the corner, and you will see the evil one crouching down inside; but you must hold the lid firmly, that he may not slip out."<p>"Will you come and help me hold it?" said the farmer, going towards the chest in which his wife had hidden the sexton, who now lay inside, very much frightened.<p>The farmer opened the lid a very little way, and peeped in. "Oh," cried he, springing backwards, "I saw him, and he is exactly like our sexton. How dreadful it is!"<p>So after that he was obliged to drink again, and they sat and drank till far into the night.<p>"You must sell your conjuror to me," said the farmer; "ask as much as you like, I will pay it; indeed I would give you directly a whole bushel of gold."<p>"No, indeed, I cannot," said Little Claus; "only think how much profit I could make out of this conjuror."<p>"But I should like to have him," said the fanner, still continuing his entreaties.<p>"Well," said Little Claus at length, "you have been so good as to give me a night&#039;s lodging, I will not refuse you; you shall have the conjuror for a bushel of money, but I will have quite full measure."<p>"So you shall," said the farmer; "but you must take away the chest as well. I would not have it in the house another hour; there is no knowing if he may not be still there."<p>So Little Claus gave the farmer the sack containing the dried horse&#039;s skin, and received in exchange a bushel of money– full measure. The farmer also gave him a wheelbarrow on which to carry away the chest and the gold.<p>"Farewell," said Little Claus, as he went off with his money and the great chest, in which the sexton lay still concealed.<p>On one side of the forest was a broad, deep river, the water flowed so rapidly that very few were able to swim against the stream. A new bridge had lately been built across it, and in the middle of this bridge Little Claus stopped, and said, loud enough to be heard by the sexton, "Now what shall I do with this stupid chest; it is as heavy as if it were full of stones: I shall be tired if I roll it any farther, so I may as well throw it in the river; if it swims after me to my house, well and good, and if not, it will not much matter."<p>So he seized the chest in his hand and lifted it up a little, as if he were going to throw it into the water.<p>"No, leave it alone," cried the sexton from within the chest; "let me out first."<p>"Oh," exclaimed Little Claus, pretending to be frightened, "he is in there still, is he? I must throw him into the river, that he may be drowned."<p>"Oh, no; oh, no," cried the sexton; "I will give you a whole bushel full of money if you will let me go."<p>"Why, that is another matter," said Little Claus, opening the chest. The sexton crept out, pushed the empty chest into the water, and went to his house, then he measured out a whole bushel full of gold for Little Claus, who had already received one from the farmer, so that now he had a barrow full.<p>"I have been well paid for my horse," said he to himself when he reached home, entered his own room, and emptied all his money into a heap on the floor. "How vexed Great Claus will be when he finds out how rich I have become all through my one horse; but I shall not tell him exactly how it all happened."<p>Then he sent a boy to Great Claus to borrow a bushel measure.<p>"What can he want it for?" thought Great Claus; so he smeared the bottom of the measure with tar, that some of whatever was put into it might stick there and remain. And so it happened; for when the measure returned, three new silver florins were sticking to it.<p>"What does this mean?" said Great Claus; so he ran off directly to Little Claus, and asked, "Where did you get so much money?"<p>"Oh, for my horse&#039;s skin, I sold it yesterday."<p>"It was certainly well paid for then," said Great Claus; and he ran home to his house, seized a hatchet, and knocked all his four horses on the head, flayed off their skins, and took them to the town to sell.<p>"Skins, skins, who&#039;ll buy skins?" he cried, as he went through the streets.<p>All the shoemakers and tanners came running, and asked how much he wanted for them.<p>"A bushel of money, for each," replied Great Claus.<p>"Are you mad?" they all cried; "do you think we have money to spend by the bushel?"<p>"Skins, skins," he cried again, "who&#039;ll buy skins?" but to all who inquired the price, his answer was, "a bushel of money."<p>"He is making fools of us," said they all; then the shoemakers took their straps, and the tanners their leather aprons, and began to beat Great Claus.<p>"Skins, skins!" they cried, mocking him; "yes, we&#039;ll mark your skin for you, till it is black and blue." - "Out of the town with him," said they. And Great Claus was obliged to run as fast as he could, he had never before been so thoroughly beaten.<p>"Ah," said he, as he came to his house; "Little Claus shall pay me for this; I will beat him to death."<p>Meanwhile the old grandmother of Little Claus died. She had been cross, unkind, and really spiteful to him; but he was very sorry, and took the dead woman and laid her in his warm bed to see if he could bring her to life again. There he determined that she should lie the whole night, while he seated himself in a chair in a corner of the room as he had often done before.<p>During the night, as he sat there, the door opened, and in came Great Claus with a hatchet. He knew well where Little Claus&#039;s bed stood; so he went right up to it, and struck the old grandmother on the head. thinking it must be Little Claus.<p>"There," cried he, "now you cannot make a fool of me again;" and then he went home.<p>"That is a very wicked man," thought Little Claus; "he meant to kill me. It is a good thing for my old grandmother that she was already dead, or he would have taken her life."<p>Then he dressed his old grandmother in her best clothes, borrowed a horse of his neighbor, and harnessed it to a cart. Then he placed the old woman on the back seat, so that she might not fall out as he drove, and rode away through the wood. By sunrise they reached a large inn, where Little Claus stopped and went to get something to eat.<p>The landlord was a rich man, and a good man too; but as passionate as if he had been made of pepper and snuff.<p>"Good morning," said he to Little Claus; "you are come betimes to-day."<p>"Yes," said Little Claus; "I am going to the town with my old grandmother; she is sitting at the back of the wagon, but I cannot bring her into the room. Will you take her a glass of mead? but you must speak very loud, for she cannot hear well."<p>"Yes, certainly I will," replied the landlord; and, pouring out a glass of mead, he carried it out to the dead grandmother, who sat upright in the cart.<p>"Here is a glass of mead from your grandson," said the landlord. The dead woman did not answer a word, but sat quite still.<p>"Do you not hear?" cried the landlord as loud as he could; "here is a glass of mead from your grandson."<p>Again and again he bawled it out, but as she did not stir he flew into a passion, and threw the glass of mead in her face; it struck her on the nose, and she fell backwards out of the cart, for she was only seated there, not tied in.<p>"Hallo!" cried Little Claus, rushing out of the door, and seizing hold of the landlord by the throat; "you have killed my grandmother; see, here is a great hole in her forehead."<p>"Oh, how unfortunate," said the landlord, wringing his hands. "This all comes of my fiery temper. Dear Little Claus, I will give you a bushel of money; I will bury your grandmother as if she were my own; only keep silent, or else they will cut off my head, and that would be disagreeable."<p>So it happened that Little Claus received another bushel of money, and the landlord buried his old grandmother as if she had been his own.<p>When Little Claus reached home again, he immediately sent a boy to Great Claus, requesting him to lend him a bushel measure.<p>"How is this?" thought Great Claus; "did I not kill him? I must go and see for myself." So he went to Little Claus, and took the bushel measure with him.<p>"How did you get all this money?" asked Great Claus, staring with wide open eyes at his neighbor&#039;s treasures.<p>"You killed my grandmother instead of me," said Little Claus; "so I have sold her for a bushel of money."<p>"That is a good price at all events," said Great Claus. So he went home, took a hatchet, and killed his old grandmother with one blow. Then he placed her on a cart, and drove into the town to the apothecary, and asked him if he would buy a dead body.<p>"Whose is it, and where did you get it?" asked the apothecary.<p>"It is my grandmother," he replied; "I killed her with a blow, that I might get a bushel of money for her."<p>"Heaven preserve us!" cried the apothecary, "you are out of your mind. Don&#039;t say such things, or you will lose your head." And then he talked to him seriously about the wicked deed he had done, and told him that such a wicked man would surely be punished. Great Claus got so frightened that he rushed out of the surgery, jumped into the cart, whipped up his horses, and drove home quickly. The apothecary and all the people thought him mad, and let him drive where he liked.<p>"You shall pay for this," said Great Claus, as soon as he got into the highroad, "that you shall, Little Claus." So as soon as he reached home he took the largest sack he could find and went over to Little Claus. "You have played me another trick," said he. "First, I killed all my horses, and then my old grandmother, and it is all your fault; but you shall not make a fool of me any more." So he laid hold of Little Claus round the body, and pushed him into the sack, which he took on his shoulders, saying, "Now I&#039;m going to drown you in the river."<p>He had a long way to go before he reached the river, and Little Claus was not a very light weight to carry. The road led by the church, and as they passed he could hear the organ playing and the people singing beautifully. Great Claus put down the sack close to the church-door, and thought he might as well go in and hear a psalm before he went any farther. Little Claus could not possibly get out of the sack, and all the people were in church; so in he went.<p>"Oh dear, oh dear," sighed Little Claus in the sack, as he turned and twisted about; but he found he could not loosen the string with which it was tied. Presently an old cattle driver, with snowy hair, passed by, carrying a large staff in his hand, with which he drove a large herd of cows and oxen before him. They stumbled against the sack in which lay Little Claus, and turned it over.<p>"Oh dear," sighed Little Claus, "I am very young, yet I am soon going to heaven."<p>"And I, poor fellow," said the drover, "I who am so old already, cannot get there."<p>"Open the sack," cried Little Claus; "creep into it instead of me, and you will soon be there."<p>"With all my heart," replied the drover, opening the sack, from which sprung Little Claus as quickly as possible.<p>"Will you take care of my cattle?" said the old man, as he crept into the bag. "Yes," said Little Claus, and he tied up the sack, and then walked off with all the cows and oxen.<p>When Great Claus came out of church, he took up the sack, and placed it on his shoulders. It appeared to have become lighter, for the old drover was not half so heavy as Little Claus. "How light he seems now," said he. "Ah, it is because I have been to a church." So he walked on to the river, which was deep and broad, and threw the sack containing the old drover into the water, believing it to be Little Claus. "There you may lie!" he exclaimed; "you will play me no more tricks now."<p>Then he turned to go home, but when he came to a place where two roads crossed, there was Little Claus driving the cattle.<p>"How is this?" said Great Claus. "Did I not drown you just now?"<p>"Yes," said Little Claus; "you threw me into the river about half an hour ago."<p>"But wherever did you get all these fine beasts?" asked Great Claus.<p>"These beasts are sea-cattle," replied Little Claus. "I&#039;ll tell you the whole story, and thank you for drowning me; I am above you now, I am really very rich. I was frightened, to be sure, while I lay tied up in the sack, and the wind whistled in my ears when you threw me into the river from the bridge, and I sank to the bottom immediately; but I did not hurt myself, for I fell upon beautifully soft grass which grows down there; and in a moment, the sack opened, and the sweetest little maiden came towards me. She had snow-white robes, and a wreath of green leaves on her wet hair. She took me by the hand, and said, &#039;So you are come, Little Claus, and here are some cattle for you to begin with. About a mile farther on the road, there is another herd for you.&#039; Then I saw that the river formed a great highway for the people who live in the sea. They were walking and driving here and there from the sea to the land at the, spot where the river terminates. The bed of the river was covered with the loveliest flowers and sweet fresh grass. The fish swam past me as rapidly as the birds do here in the air. How handsome all the people were, and what fine cattle were grazing on the hills and in the valleys!"<p>"But why did you come up again," said Great Claus, "if it was all so beautiful down there? I should not have done so?"<p>"Well," said Little Claus, "it was good policy on my part; you heard me say just now that I was told by the sea-maiden to go a mile farther on the road, and I should find a whole herd of cattle. By the road she meant the river, for she could not travel any other way; but I knew the winding of the river, and how it bends, sometimes to the right and sometimes to the left, and it seemed a long way, so I chose a shorter one; and, by coming up to the land, and then driving across the fields back again to the river, I shall save half a mile, and get all my cattle more quickly."<p>"What a lucky fellow you are!" exclaimed Great Claus. "Do you think I should get any sea-cattle if I went down to the bottom of the river?"<p>"Yes, I think so," said Little Claus; "but I cannot carry you there in a sack, you are too heavy. However if you will go there first, and then creep into a sack, I will throw you in with the greatest pleasure."<p>"Thank you," said Great Claus; "but remember, if I do not get any sea-cattle down there I shall come up again and give you a good thrashing."<p>"No, now, don&#039;t be too fierce about it!" said Little Claus, as they walked on towards the river. When they approached it, the cattle, who were very thirsty, saw the stream, and ran down to drink.<p>"See what a hurry they are in," said Little Claus, "they are longing to get down again,"<p>"Come, help me, make haste," said Great Claus; "or you&#039;ll get beaten." So he crept into a large sack, which had been lying across the back of one of the oxen. "Put in a stone," said Great Claus, "or I may not sink."<p>"Oh, there&#039;s not much fear of that," he replied; still he put a large stone into the bag, and then tied it tightly, and gave it a push. "Plump!" In went Great Claus, and immediately sank to the bottom of the river.<p>"I&#039;m afraid he will not find any cattle," said Little Claus, and then he drove his own beasts homewards.

Not a Pin to Choose Between Them
ONCE on a time there was a man, and he had a wife. Now this couple wanted to sow their fields, but they had neither seed-corn nor money to buy it with. But they had a cow, and the man was to drive it into town and sell it, to get money to buy corn for seed. But when it came to the pinch, the wife dared not let her husband start, for fear he should spend the money in drink, so she set off herself with the cow, and took besides a hen with her.<p>Close by the town she met a butcher, who asked,—<p>"Will you sell that cow, Goody?"<p>"Yes, that I will," she answered.<p>"Well, what do you want for her?"<p>"Oh! I must have five shillings for the cow, but you shall have the hen for ten pound."<p>"Very good!" said the man; "I don&#039;t want the hen, and you&#039;ll soon get it off your hands in the town; but I&#039;ll give you five shillings for the cow."<p>Well, she sold her cow for five shillings, but there was no one in the town who would give ten pound for a lean tough old hen, so she went back to the butcher, and said,—<p>"Do all I can, I can&#039;t get rid of this hen, master! you must take it too, as you took the cow."<p>"Well," said the butcher, "come along and we&#039;ll see about it." Then he treated her both with meat and drink, and gave her so much brandy that she lost her head, and didn&#039;t know what she was about, and fell fast asleep. But while she slept, the butcher took and dipped her into a tar-barrel, and then laid her down on a heap of feathers; and when she woke up she was feathered all over, and began to wonder what had befallen her.<p>"Is it me, or is it not me? No, it can never be me; it must be some great strange bird. But what shall I do to find out whether it is me or not. Oh! I know how I shall be able to tell whether it is me; if the calves come and lick me, and our dog Tray doesn&#039;t bark at me when I get home, then it must be me and no one else."<p>Now, Tray, her dog, had scarce set his eyes on the strange monster which came through the gate, than he set up such a barking, one would have thought all the rogues and robbers in the world were in the yard.<p>"Ah! deary me!" said she, "I thought so; it can&#039;t be me surely." So she went to the straw-yard, and the calves wouldn&#039;t lick her, when they snuffed in the strong smell of tar.<p>"No, no!" she said, "it can&#039;t be me; it must be some strange outlandish bird."<p>So she crept up on the roof of the safe and began to flap her arms, as if they had been wings, and was just going to fly off.<p>When her husband saw all this, out he came with his rifle, and began to take aim at her.<p>"Oh!" cried his wife, "don&#039;t shoot, don&#039;t shoot! it is only me!"<p>"If it&#039;s you," said her husband, "don&#039;t stand up there like a goat on a house-top, but come down and let me hear what you have to say for yourself."<p>So she crawled down again, but she hadn&#039;t a shilling to show, for the crown she had got from the butcher she had thrown away in her drunkenness. When her husband heard her story, he said "You&#039;re only twice as silly as you were before," and he got so angry that he made up his mind to go away from her altogether, and never to come back till he had found three other Goodies as silly as his own.<p>So he toddled off, and when he had walked a little way he saw a Goody, who was running in and out of a newly-built wooden cottage with an empty sieve, and every time she ran in she threw her apron over the sieve, just as if she had something in it, and when she got in she turned it up-side down on the floor.<p>"Why, Goody!" he asked, "what are you doing?"<p>"Oh," she answered, "I&#039;m only carrying in a little sun but I don&#039;t know how it is, when I&#039;m outside I have the sun in my sieve, but when I get inside, somehow or other I&#039;ve thrown it away. But in my old cottage I had plenty of sun, though I never carried in the least bit. I only wish I knew some one who would bring the sun inside; I&#039;d give him three hundred dollars and welcome."<p>"Have you got an axe?" asked the man. "If you have, I&#039;ll soon bring the sun inside."<p>So he got an axe and cut windows in the cottage, for the carpenters had forgotten them; then the sun shone in, and he got his three hundred dollars.<p>"That was one of them," said the man to himself, as he went on his way.<p>After a while he passed by a house, out of which came an awful screaming and bellowing; so he turned in and saw a Goody, who was hard at work banging her husband across the head with a beetle, and over his head she had drawn a shirt without any slit for the neck.<p>"Why, Goody!" he asked, "will you beat your husband to death?"<p>"No," she said, "I only must have a hole in this shirt for his neck to come through."<p>All the while the husband kept on screaming and calling out,—<p>"Heaven help and comfort all who try on new shirts! If any one would teach my Goody another way of making a slit for the neck in my new shirts I&#039;d give him three hundred dollars down, and welcome."<p>"I&#039;ll do it in the twinkling of an eye," said the man, "if you&#039;ll only give me a pair of scissors."<p>So he got a pair of scissors, and snipped a hole in the the neck, and went off with his three hundred dollars.<p>"That was another of them," he said to himself, as he walked along.<p>Last of all, he came to a farm, where he made up his mind to rest a bit. So when he went in, the mistress asked him,—<p>"Whence do you come, master?"<p>"Oh!" said he, "I come from Paradise Place," for that was the name of his farm.<p>"From Paradise Place!" she cried, "you don&#039;t say so! Why, then, you must know my second husband Peter, who is dead and gone, God rest his soul!"<p>For you must know this Goody had been married three times, and as her first and last husbands had been bad, she had made up her mind that the second only was gone to heaven.<p>"Oh! yes," said the man; "I know him very well."<p>"Well," asked the Goody, "how do things go with him, poor dear soul?"<p>"Only middling," was the answer; "he goes about begging from house to house, and has neither food nor a rag to his back. As for money, he hasn&#039;t a sixpence to bless himself with."<p>"Mercy on me!" cried out the Goody; "he never ought to go about such a figure when he left so much behind him. Why, there&#039;s a whole cupboard full of old clothes upstairs which belonged to him, besides a great chest full of money yonder. Now, if you will take them with you, you shall have a horse and cart to carry them. As for the horse, he can keep it, and sit on the cart, and drive about from house to house, and then he needn&#039;t trudge on foot."<p>So the man got a whole cart-load of clothes, and a chest full of shining dollars, and as much meat and drink as he would; and when he had got all he wanted, he jumped into the cart and drove off.<p>"That was the third," he said to himself, as he went along.<p>Now this Goody&#039;s third husband was a little way off in a field ploughing, and when he saw a strange man driving off from the farm with his horse and cart, he went home and asked his wife who that was that had just started with the black horse.<p>"Oh, do you mean him?" said the Goody; "why, that was a man from Paradise, who said that Peter, my dear second husband, who is dead and gone, is in a sad plight, and that he goes from house to house begging, and has neither clothes nor money; so I just sent him all those old clothes he left behind him, and the old money box with the dollars in it."<p>The man saw how the land lay in a trice, so he saddled his horse and rode off from the farm at full gallop. It wasn&#039;t long before he was close behind the man who sat and drove the cart; but when the latter saw this he drove the cart into a thicket by the side of the road, pulled out a handful of hair from the horse&#039;s tail, jumped up on a little rise in the wood, where he tied the hair fast to a birch, and then lay down under it, and began to peer and stare up at the sky.<p>"Well, well, if I ever!" he said, as Peter the third came riding up. "No! I never saw the like of this in all my born days!"<p>Then Peter stood and looked at him for some time, wondering what had come over him; but at last he asked,—<p>"What do you lie there staring at?"<p>"No," kept on the man, "I never did see anything like it!—here is a man going straight up to heaven on a black horse, and here you see his horse&#039;s tail still hanging in this birch; and yonder up in the sky you see the black horse."<p>Peter looked first at the man, and then at the sky, and said—<p>"I see nothing but the horse hair in the birch; that&#039;s all I see."<p>"Of course you can&#039;t where you stand," said the man; but just come and lie down here, and stare straight up, and mind you don&#039;t take your eyes off the sky; and then you shall see what you shall see."<p>But while Peter the third lay and stared up at the sky till his eyes filled with tears, the man from Paradise Place took his horse and jumped on its back, and rode off both with it and the cart and horse.<p>When the hoofs thundered along the road, Peter the third jumped up, but he was so taken aback when he found the man had gone off with his horse, that he hadn&#039;t the sense to run after him till it was too late.<p>He was rather down in the mouth when he got home to his Goody; but when she asked him what he had done with the horse, he said,—<p>"I gave it to the man too for Peter the second, for I thought it wasn&#039;t right he should sit in a cart and scramble about from house to house; so now he can sell the cart and buy himself a coach to drive about in."<p>"Thank you heartily!" said his wife; "I never thought you could be so kind."<p>Well, when the man reached home, who had got the six hundred dollars and the cart-load of clothes and money, he saw that all his fields were ploughed and sown, and the first thing he asked his wife was, where she had got the seed-corn from.<p>"Oh," she said, "I have always heard that what a man sows he shall reap, so I sowed the salt which our friends the north country men laid up here with us, and if we only have rain I fancy it will come up nicely."<p>"Silly you are," said her husband, "and silly you will be so long as you live; but that is all one now, for the rest are not a bit wiser than you. There is not a pin to choose between you."<br>

Odds and ends
There was once on a time a maiden who was pretty, but idle and negligent. When she had to spin she was so out of temper that if there was a little knot in the flax, she at once pulled out a whole heap of it, and strewed it about on the ground beside her. Now she had a servant who was industrious, and gathered together the bits of flax which were thrown away, cleaned them, span them fine, and had a beautiful gown made out of them for herself. A young man had wooed the lazy girl, and the wedding was to take place. On the eve of the wedding, the industrious one was dancing merrily about in her pretty dress, and the bride said,-<p>"Ah, how that girl does jump about, <br>dressed in my odds and ends." <p>The bridegroom heard that, and asked the bride what she meant by it? Then she told him that the girl was wearing a dress make of the flax which she had thrown away. When the bridegroom heard that, and saw how idle she was, and how industrious the poor girl was, he gave her up and went to the other, and chose her as his wife.

Our Parish Clerk
"Once on a time there was a clerk in our parish, who was very sharp set after all that was nice and good. All the parish said his brains were in his belly, for though he was very fond of pretty girls and buxom wives, still he liked good meat and drink even better.<br>"&#039;Aye, aye,&#039; said our clerk; &#039;one can&#039;t live long on love and the south wind.&#039; That was his motto, and that was why he kept company most with well-to-do-house-wives, with those who were new wedded, or with pretty lasses who were sure to marry rich husbands, for there you were sure to find titbits both of beauty and food. That was what our clerk thought. It wasn&#039;t every one, indeed, who thought it so fine to have such a cupboard lover, but yet there were some who looked on it as fine enough for them, for, after all, a parish clerk stands a little higher than a farmer.<p>"Now it fell out there was a rich young lass who had married our clerk&#039;s next-door neighbour. There he crept in and out, and soon got good friends with the husband, and better friends still with his wife. When the husband was at home all went well between them, but as soon as he was away at the mill, or in the wood, or at floating timber, or at a meeting, the goody sent word to the clerk, and then the two spent the day in revelling and mirth. There was no one who found this out, before the ploughboy got wind of it, and he thought he would just speak of it to his master; but, somehow or other, he couldn&#039;t find a fitting time till one day when they were together in the outfield gathering leaves for litter. There they chatted this and that about lasses and wives, and the master thought he had made a lucky hit in marrying such a rich and pretty wife, and he said as much outright.<p>"&#039;Thank God, she is both good and clever.&#039;<p>"&#039;Aye, aye,&#039; said the lad; &#039;every man is welcome to believe what he likes, but if you knew her as well as I do, you wouldn&#039;t say such words at random. Pretty women are like wind in warm summer weather.<p><br>&#039;And love is such that, willy, nilly,<br>It takes up with a clerk as well as a lily.&#039;<p><br>"&#039;What&#039;s that you say?&#039; said the man.<p>"&#039;I have long thought I would tell you that there&#039;s a black bull that walks hoof to hoof and horn to horn with that milk-white cow in your mead, master--that&#039;s what I wanted to say.&#039;<p>"&#039;One can say much in a summer day,&#039; said the man; &#039;but I can&#039;t understand what this points to.&#039;<p>"&#039;Is it so?&#039; said the lad. &#039;Well, I have long thought of telling you that our clerk is often and ever in our house with the mistress, and how they lived as though there was a bridal every day, while we scarce get so much as the leavings of their good cheer.&#039;<p><br>"&#039;He who will ever taste and try,<br>Will burn his fingers in the pie,&#039;<p><br>said his master. &#039;I don&#039;t believe a word of what you say.&#039;<p>"&#039;It&#039;s a strange ear that will never hear,&#039; said the lad; &#039;but seeing is believing, and if you will listen to me, I&#039;m ready to wager ten dollars that you shall soon have the proof in your own hands.&#039;<p>"&#039;Done,&#039; said the master; &#039;he would bet ten dollars; nay, for that matter, he would bet horse and farm, and a hundred dollars into the bargain.&#039;<p>"Well, that wager was to stand. &#039;But an old fox is hard to hunt,&#039; said the lad, and so his master must say and do all that his ploughboy wished. When they got home he was to say they must set off for the river and land timber, and his wife must put up some food for them in hot haste; it was best to look out while the weather was fine, it might turn to storm in a trice. Yes! That was what the husband said, and the food was ready to the minute. The lad put the horses to the timber drags, and off they went, but no farther than half a mile; there they put the horses up at a farm, and turned in themselves. As the night came on they went back, and when they got home, the door was locked fast.<p>"&#039;Now we have him,&#039; said the lad; &#039;it&#039;s hard to keep off the field to which one is wont.&#039;<p>"So they went by the back way from the garden, and so through a trap-door in the cellar into the kitchen. Then they struck a light and went into the parlour, and saw what they saw. Well! our clerk had eaten so well that he lay snoring with his mouth open and his nose in the air; as for the goody, she was not awake either.<p>"&#039;Now you see I was right; seeing is believing, master,&#039; said the lad.<p>"&#039;May I never speak the truth again,&#039; said the man, &#039;if I would have believed ten men telling it.&#039;<p>"&#039;Hush, be still,&#039; said the lad, and took him out again.<p>"&#039;Man&#039;s law is not land&#039;s law,&#039; said the lad; &#039;but even a bear can be tamed if you know how to deal with him. Have you any lead, master?<p>"Yes! He had, he was sure, more than seventy bullets in his pouch. Then it was all right. They took a sauce-pan, and melted the lead on the spot, and ran it down our clerk&#039;s throat.<p>"&#039;Every man has his own taste,&#039; said the lad, &#039;and that&#039;s why all meat is eaten,&#039; as he heard the molten lead bubbling and frizzling in our clerk&#039;s throat.<p>"Then they went out by the way they got in, and began to knock and thunder at the front door. The wife woke up and asked who was there.<p>"&#039;It is I, open the door, I say,&#039; said the husband.<p>"Then she gave our clerk a nudge in the ribs. &#039;It is the master; the master is back,&#039; she said. But no! he did not mind her, and never so much as stirred. Then she put her knees to his side, and tumbled him on to the floor, and jumped up and took him by the legs, and dragged him to the heap of wood behind the stove, and there she hid him. Till she had done that she had no time to open the door to her husband.<p>"&#039;Were you gone after christening water, that you were gone so long?&#039; asked the man.<p>"&#039;Oh!&#039; she answered; &#039;I dozed off again to sleep, and I did not think it could ever be you either.&#039;<p>"&#039;Well!&#039; said her husband; &#039;now you must bring out some food, for me and the boy, we are a&#039;most starved.&#039;<p>"&#039;I&#039;ve got no food ready,&#039; said the goody. &#039;How can you think of such a thing? I never thought you would be back either to-day or to-morrow. Why you know you were to go to the river to land timber.&#039;<p>"&#039;One can&#039;t hang a hungry man up on the wall like a clock,&#039; said the lad; &#039;and self-help is the best help; shall I bring in the food we packed up, master.&#039;<p>"Yes; they did that, and they sat down to eat out of the knapsack; but when they got up to put a log or two on the fire, there lay our clerk among the pile of wood.<p>"&#039;Why who in the world is this?&#039; asked the man.<p>"&#039;Oh! oh! It&#039;s only a beggar man who came here so late and begged for house-room; he was quite content if he might only lie among the firewood,&#039; said the goody.<p>"&#039;A pretty beggar,&#039; said the man; &#039;why he has got silver buckles to his shoes, and silver buttons at his knees.&#039;<p>"&#039;All are not beggars who are tattered and torn,&#039; said the lad; &#039;but I&#039;m blessed if this isn&#039;t our parish clerk.&#039;<p>"&#039;What was he doing here, mistress,&#039; asked her husband, who all the while kept on pulling and kicking at him. But our clerk never so much as stirred or lifted a finger, There stood the goody fumbling and stammering, and not knowing what to say. All she could do was to bite her thumb.<p>"&#039;I see it in your face, what you have done, mistress,&#039; said her husband. &#039;But life is hard to lose, and, after all, he was our parish clerk. If I did what was right, I should send off at once for the sheriff.&#039;<p>"&#039;Heaven help us,&#039; said his wife; &#039;only get our clerk out of the way.&#039;<p>"&#039;This is your matter, and not mine,&#039; said the man. &#039;I never asked him hither, nor sent for him; but if you can get any one to help you to get rid of him, I won&#039;t stand in your way.&#039;<p>"Then she took the lad on one side, and said,--<p>"&#039;I&#039;ve laid up some woollen stuff for my husband, but I&#039;ll give it to you for clothes, if you&#039;ll only get our clerk buried, so that he shall never be seen or heard of again.&#039;<p>"&#039;There&#039;s no saying what one can do till one tries. If we drive in the frost, we shall find it slippery, to our cost. Have you ropes and cord, master? if so, I&#039;ll see if I can&#039;t cure this.&#039;<p>"Well! he got our clerk fast in a slipknot, threw him on his back, caught up his hat as well, and away he went. But he hadn&#039;t gone far along the path in the meadow when he met some horses; so he caught one of these, and tied and bound our clerk fast on his back. He put his hat, too, on his head, and his hand down on his thigh, and there he sat upright, and jogged up and down just as a man on horseback.<p>"&#039;One may kill trolls at any time of night,&#039; said the lad, when he got home; &#039;who can say when a man is &#039;fey.&#039; But he will never rise up who is safe buried under ground, and the cock that is slain crows never again.&#039;<p>"Now, whether all this were true or no, there was a way from the meadow across the fields to a barn, and along it they had carted hay, and dropped it as they went along; so the horse went that way, picking up the hay as he went, and out in that barn were two men watching for thieves who used to steal the hay, for it had been a bad year for fodder.<p>"&#039;Here comes the thief,&#039; they said, when they heard the horse&#039;s hoofs; &#039;now we shall catch him.&#039;<p>"&#039;Who&#039;s there,&#039; they called out, so that it rang against the hillside. No! there was no answer, the horse paid little heed, and our clerk less.<p>"&#039;If you don&#039;t answer I&#039;ll send a bullet through your brains, you horse-thief,&#039; they both called out, and then off went the gun, at which the horse gave such a sudden jump, that our clerk gave a bob, and fell bump on the ground.<p>"&#039;I think,&#039; said one of the watchers, as he jumped up to look, &#039;I think you&#039;ve shot him dead as mutton;&#039; and then, when he saw who it was, &#039;Oh Lord!&#039; he said, &#039;if it ain&#039;t our parish clerk. You ought to have aimed at his legs, and not killed him outright.&#039;<p>"&#039;What&#039;s done is done, and can&#039;t be helped,&#039; said the other. &#039;Least said soonest mended. We must keep our ears close, and bury him for a little while among the hay in the barn.&#039;<p>"Yes! They did that, and when it was over, they lay them down to rest. In a little while came some one puffing and stamping, that the field shook again. The two who lay among the hay nudged one another, for they thought it was thieves again. Close to the barn was a stepping-stone, and there the new-comer sat down with his load, and began to talk to himself. He had been killing pigs at a farm a few days before, and thought he had been paid too little for his work, too little pay and too little board, and so he had set off and stolen the biggest porker. &#039;He that swaps with a bear always comes worst off,&#039; he said; &#039;and so it&#039;s best to help one&#039;s self to what is right, and a little share is better than a long law-suit. But, bitter death! If I haven&#039;t forgotten my gloves; if they find them at the farm, they&#039;ll soon find out who has inherited their porker.&#039; And, as he said this, he bolted back after his gloves.<p>"The two who were in the barn lay and listened to all this.<p>"&#039;He who lays traps for others, comes into the trap himself,&#039; said one.<p>"&#039;There&#039;s no sin in stealing from a thief,&#039; said the other; &#039;and no one is hanged, save those who can&#039;t steal right. It would be fine fun to get rid of our clerk in an easy way, and get a fat pig instead. I think, old chap, we had better make a swap.&#039;<p>"The other burst out laughing at this, and so they tumbled the pig out of the sack and tossed in our clerk, head foremost, hat and all, and tied up the mouth of the sack as tight as they could.<p>"Just as they had done, back came the thief flying with his gloves, snatched up the sack, and strode off home. There he cast the sack down on the floor at his goody&#039;s feet.<p>"&#039;Here&#039;s what I call a porker, old lass,&#039; he said.<p>"&#039;How grand!&#039; said the goody. &#039;Nothing is all very fine to the eye, but not to the mouth. One can&#039;t get on without meat, for meat is man&#039;s strength. Thank Heaven we have now a bit of meat in the house, and shall be able to live well awhile.&#039;<p>"&#039;I took the biggest I could,&#039; said the man, who sat down in his armchair, and puffed and wiped the sweat off his brow. &#039;He had both breeches and drawers, he was well covered, that he was.&#039; By which he meant the pig was well fed and fat. Then he went on, &#039;Have you any meat in the house, old lass?&#039;<p>"&#039;No,&#039; she said; &#039;meat! where should I get meat?&#039;<p>"&#039;Make up the fire then,&#039; said the man; &#039;and sharpen your knife, and cut off a wee bit, and fry it with salt, and let&#039;s have a pork chop.&#039;<p>"She did as he bade, and tore open the mouth of the sack, and was just going to cut off a steak.<p>"&#039;What&#039;s all this?&#039; she cried. &#039;He has got his trotters on,&#039; when she saw his shoes; &#039;and he&#039;s as black as a coal.&#039;<p>"&#039;Don&#039;t you know,&#039; said her husband; &#039;all cats are grey in the dark, and all pigs black.&#039;<p>"&#039;I dare say,&#039; she said; &#039;but black or white is always bright, and a fog is not like a bilberry. This pig has got breeches on.&#039;<p>"&#039;Plague take him!&#039; said the man. &#039;I know well enough he is covered with fat all down his legs. Haven&#039;t I carried him till the sweat ran down my face?&#039;<p>"&#039;Nay, nay!&#039; said the goody. &#039;He has silver buckles in his shoes, and silver buttons at his knees. My! if it isn&#039;t our Parish Clerk!&#039; she screamed out.<p>"&#039;I tell you it was a fat pig I took,&#039; said the man, as he jumped up to see how things stood. &#039;Well! Well! Seeing is believing.&#039; It was our clerk, both with shoes and buckles; but, for all, he stuck to it, it was the fattest pig he had put into the sack.<p>"&#039;But what&#039;s done can&#039;t be undone,&#039; he said; &#039;the best servant is one&#039;s own self; but, for all that, help is good, even if it comes out of the porridge-pot; wake up our Mary, old girl.&#039;<p>"Now you must know Mary was their daughter, a ready and trusty lass; she had the strength of a man too, and always had her wits about her. So she was to take our clerk and bury him in an out-of-the-way dale, so that nothing should ever be heard of him. If she did this, she was to have a new suit of working clothes, which were meant for her mother.<p>"Well! The lassie took our clerk round the body, tossed him on her back, and strode off from the farm, not forgetting to take his hat. But when she had gone a bit of the way, she heard a fiddle going, for there was a dance at a farm near the road, and so she crept in and set our clerk down upright behind the back-stairs. There he sat with his hat between his hands, just as though he were begging an alms, and leaning against the wall and a post.<p>"After a while came a girl in a flurry.<p>"&#039;I wonder whoever this can be,&#039; she said. &#039;The master of the house is as grey as a goose, but this fellow is black as a raven. Halloa, you sir, why are you sitting there, blocking up the way? One can scarce get by.&#039;<p>"But our clerk said never a word.<p>"&#039;Are you poor? Do you beg for a penny for Heaven&#039;s sake? Ah! poor fellow! Here&#039;s two pence for you,&#039; and as she said this she tossed them into his hat. Still our clerk said never a word. She waited a little, for she thought he would say &#039;Thank you,&#039; but our clerk did not so much as nod his head.<p>"&#039;No, I never,&#039; said the girl, when she went back into the ball-room. &#039;I never did see the like of a beggar who sits out yonder by the staircase. He isn&#039;t at all like a starling on a fence,&#039; she went on; &#039;for he won&#039;t answer, and he won&#039;t say "Thank you," and won&#039;t so much as lift a finger, though I did give him two pence.&#039;<p>"&#039;The least a beggar can do is to say "Thank you,"&#039; cried a young sheriff&#039;s clerk who was of the party. &#039;He must be a pretty fellow whom I cannot get to speak, for I&#039;ve made thieves and stiff-necked folk open their mouths wide before this.&#039;<p>"As he said this he ran out to the stairs, and bawled out in our clerk&#039;s ear, for he thought he was hard of hearing.<p>"&#039;What do you sit here for, you sir?&#039; And then again, &#039;Are you poor? Do you beg?&#039;<p>"No, our clerk said never a word. So he took out half-a-dollar, and threw it into his hat, saying, &#039;There&#039;s something for you.&#039; But our clerk was still silent, and made no sign. So when he could get no thanks out of him, the sheriff&#039;s officer gave him a blow under the ear, as hard as he could, and down fell our clerk head over heels across the staircase. And you may be sure the girl Mary was not slow in running to the spot.<p>"&#039;Are you in a swoon, or are you dead, father,&#039; she screeched out, and then she went on screaming and bewailing herself.<p>"&#039;It&#039;s quite true,&#039; she said; &#039;there&#039;s no peace for the poor after all, but I never yet heard of any one laying themselves out to strike beggars dead.&#039;<p>"&#039;Hush! Hold your tongue,&#039; said the sheriff&#039;s officer. &#039;Don&#039;t make a fuss. Here you have ten dollars, keep your peace and take him away. I only gave him a blow that made him swoon.&#039;<p>"Well! She was glad enough. &#039;Money brings money,&#039; she thought; &#039;with fair words and money, one can go far in a day, and one need never care for food with a purse full of pence.&#039; So she took our clerk on her back again, and strode off to the nearest farm, and there she put him athwart the brink of the well. When our Mary got home she said she had borne him off to the wood, and buried him far far away in a side dale.<p>"&#039;Thank Heaven,&#039; said the goody. &#039;Now we are well quit of him, you shall have all I promised, and more besides. Be sure of that.&#039;<p>"So there lay our clerk, as though he were peering down into the well, till at dawn of day the ploughboy came running up to draw water.<p>"&#039;Why are you lying there, and what are you gazing at? Out of the way. I want some water,&#039; said the lad.<p>"No! He neither stirred hand or foot. Then the lad let drive at him, so that it went plump, and there lay our clerk in the well. Then he must have help to get him out, but there was no help for it till the hind came with a boat-hook and dragged him out.<p>"&#039;Why! it&#039;s our Parish Clerk!&#039; they all bawled out, and they all thought he had eaten and drank so much at some feast, that he had fallen asleep by the well-side.<p>"But when the master of the house came and saw our clerk, and heard how it had all happened, he said,--<p>"&#039;Harm watches while men sleep; but man&#039;s scathe is the worst scathe. When one pot strikes against another, both break. Take the saddle and lay it on Blackie, and ride to fetch the sheriff, my lad, and then we shall be out of harm&#039;s way, for our clerk&#039;s sake. Mishaps never come single, but it&#039;s hard to drown on dry land.&#039; That was what the master said.<p>"Yes! The lad rode off to the sheriff, and after a while the sheriff came. But, as the saying is, more haste, worse speed, and work done in haste will never last. So it took time before they got the doctor and witnesses to come. Now you all know we owe a death to God; but then it was made as plain as day that our clerk had been killed three times before he tumbled into the well. First the ladle of lead had taken away his breath, next he had a bullet through his forehead, and third and last his neck was broken. Surely he was &#039;fey&#039; when he set out to see the goody. It is hard to tell how all this was found out at last; but tongues will clack behind a man&#039;s back, and hard things are said of a man when he&#039;s dead."<br>

Peik
Once on a time there was a man, and he had a wife; they had a son and a daughter who were twins, and they were so like, no one could tell the one from the other by anything else than their clothing. The boy they called Peik. He was of little good while his father and mother lived, for he had no mood to do aught else than to befool folk, and he was so full of tricks and pranks that no one could be at peace for him; but when they were dead it got worse and worse, he wouldn&#039;t turn his hand to anything; all he would do was to squander what they left behind them, and as for his neighbours he fell out with all of them. His sister toiled and moiled all she could, but it helped little; so at last she said to him how silly this was that he would do naught for her house, and ended by asking him,<p>&#039;What shall we have to live on when you have wasted everything?&#039;<p>&#039;Oh, I&#039;ll go out and befool somebody,&#039; said Peik.<p>&#039;Yes, Peik, I&#039;ll be bound you&#039;ll do that soon enough,&#039; said his sister.<p>&#039;Well, I&#039;ll try,&#039; said Peik.<p>So at last they had nothing more, for there was an end of everything; and Peik trotted off, and walked and walked till he came to the king&#039;s grange. There stood the King in the porch, and as soon as he set eyes on the lad, he said,--<p>&#039;Whither away to-day, Peik?&#039;<p>&#039;Oh, I was going out to see if I could befool anybody,&#039; said Peik.<p>&#039;Can&#039;t you befool me, now?&#039; said the King.<p>&#039;No, I&#039;m sure I can&#039;t,&#039; said Peik, &#039;for I&#039;ve forgotten my fooling rods at home.&#039;<p>&#039;Can&#039;t you go and fetch them?&#039; said the King, &#039;for I should be very glad to see if you are such a trickster as folks say.&#039;<p>&#039;I&#039;ve no strength to walk,&#039; said Peik.<p>&#039;I&#039;ll lend you a horse and saddle,&#039; said the King.<p>&#039;But I can&#039;t ride either,&#039; said Peik.<p>&#039;Then we&#039;ll lift you up,&#039; said the King, &#039;then you&#039;ll be able to stick on.&#039;<p>Well, Peik stood and clawed and scratched his head, as though he would pull the hair off, and let them lift him up into the saddle, and there he sat swinging this side and that so long as the King could see him, and the King laughed till the tears came into his eyes, for such a tailor on horseback he had never before seen. But when Peik was come well into the wood behind the hill, so that he was out of the King&#039;s sight, he sat as though he were nailed to the horse, and off he rode as though he had stolen both steed and bridle, and when he got to the town, he sold both horse and saddle.<p>All the while the King walked up and down, and loitered and waited for Peik to come tottering back again with his fooling rods; and every now and then he laughed when he called to mind how wretched he looked as he sat swinging about on the horse like a sack of corn, not knowing on which side to fall off; but this lasted for seven lengths and seven breadths, and no Peik came, and so at last the King saw that he was fooled and cheated out of his horse and saddle, even though Peik had not his fooling rods with him. And so there was another story, for the King got wroth, and was all for setting off to kill Peik.<p>But Peik had found out the day he was coming, and told his sister she must put on the big boiler with a drop of water in it. But just as the King came in Peik dragged the boiler off the fire and ran off with it to the chopping-block, and so boiled the porridge on the block.<p>The King wondered at that, and wondered on and on so much that he clean forgot what brought him there.<p>&#039;What do you want for that pot?&#039; said he.<p>&#039;I can&#039;t spare it,&#039; said Peik.<p>&#039;Why not?&#039; said the King, &#039;I&#039;ll pay what you ask.&#039;<p>&#039;No, no!&#039; said Peik. &#039;It saves me time and money, woodhire and choppinghire, carting and carrying.&#039;<p>&#039;Never mind,&#039; said the King, &#039;I&#039;ll give you a hundred dollars. It&#039;s true you&#039;ve fooled me out of a horse and saddle, and bridle besides, but all that shall go for nothing if I can only get the pot.&#039;<p>&#039;Well! if you must have it you must,&#039; said Peik.<p>When the King got home he asked guests and made a feast, but the meat was to be boiled in the new pot, and so he took it up and set it in the middle of the floor. The guests thought the King had lost his wits, and went about elbowing one another, and laughing at him. But he walked round and round the pot, and cackled and chattered, saying all in a breath--<p>&#039;Well, well! bide a bit, bide a bit! &#039;twill boil in a minute.&#039;<p>But there was no boiling. So he saw that Peik had been out again with his fooling rods and cheated him, and now he would set off at once and slay him.<p>When the King came Peik stood out by the barn door. &#039;Wouldn&#039;t it boil?&#039; he asked.<p>&#039;No! it would not,&#039; said the King; &#039;but now you shall smart for it,&#039; and so he was just going to unsheath his knife.<p>&#039;I can well believe that,&#039; said Peik, &#039;for you did not take the block too.&#039;<p>&#039;I wish I thought,&#039; said the King, &#039;you weren&#039;t telling me a pack of lies.&#039;<p>&#039;I tell you it&#039;s all because of the block it stands on; it won&#039;t boil without it,&#039; said Peik.<p>&#039;Well; what did he want for it?&#039; It was well worth three hundred dollars; but for the King&#039;s sake it should go for two. So he got the block and travelled home with it, and bade guests again, and made a feast, and set the pot on the chopping-block in the middle of the room. The guests thought he was both daft and mad, and they went about making game of him, while he cackled and chattered round the pot, calling out &#039;Bide a bit, now it boils! now it boils in a trice.&#039;<p>But it wouldn&#039;t boil a bit more on the block than on the bare floor. So he saw again that Peik had been out with his fooling rods this time too. Then he fell a-tearing his hair, and swore he would set off at once and slay him. He wouldn&#039;t spare him this time, whether he put a good or a bad face on it.<p>But Peik had taken steps to meet him again. He slaughtered a wether and caught the blood in the bladder, and stuffed it into his sister&#039;s bosom, and told her what to say and do.<p>&#039;Where&#039;s Peik!&#039; screeched out the King. He was in such a rage that his tongue faltered.<p>He is so poorly that he can&#039;t stir hand or foot,&#039; she said, &#039;and now he&#039;s trying to get a nap.&#039;<p>&#039;Wake him up,&#039; said the King.<p>&#039;Nay, I daren&#039;t; he is so hasty,&#039; said the sister.<p>&#039;Well! I&#039;m hastier still,&#039; said the King, &#039;and if you don&#039;t wake him, I will,&#039; and with that he tapped his side where his knife hung.<p>Well! she would go and wake him; but Peik turned hastily in his bed, drew out a little knife, and ripped open the bladder in her bosom, so that a stream of blood gushed out, and down she fell on the floor, as though she were dead.<p>&#039;What a dare devil you are, Peik,&#039; said the King, &#039;if you haven&#039;t stabbed your sister to death, and here I stood by and saw it with my own eyes.&#039;<p>&#039;There&#039;s no risk with her body so long as there&#039;s breath in my nostrils;&#039; and with that he pulled out a ramshorn, and began to toot upon it, and when he had tooted a bridal tune, he put the end to her body, and blew life into her again, and up she rose as though there was naught the matter with her.<p>&#039;Bless me, Peik! can you kill folk and blow life into them again? Can you do that?&#039; said the King.<p>&#039;Why!&#039; said Peik, &#039;how could I get on at all if I couldn&#039;t? I&#039;m always killing everyone I come near; don&#039;t you know I&#039;m very hasty.&#039;<p><br> <br>&#039;So am I hot-tempered,&#039; said the King, &#039;and that horn I must have; I&#039;ll give you a hundred dollars for it, and besides I&#039;ll forgive you for cheating me out of my horse, and for fooling me about the pot and the block, and all else.&#039;<p>Peik was very loth to part with it, but for his sake he would let him have it, and so the King went off home with it, and he had hardly got back before he must try it. So he fell a-wrangling and quarrelling with the Queen and his eldest daughter, and they paid him back in the same coin; but before they knew a word about it he whipped out his knife and cut their throats, so that they fell down stone dead, and everyone else ran out of the room, they were so afraid.<p>The King walked and paced about the floor for a while, and kept chattering that there was no harm done, so long as there was breath in him, and a pack of such stuff which had flowed out of Peik&#039;s mouth, and then he pulled out the horn and began to blow &#039;Toot-i-too, Toot-i-too,&#039; but though he blew and tooted as hard as he could all that day and the next too, he couldn&#039;t blow life into them again. Dead they were, and dead they stayed, both the Queen and his daughter, and he was forced to buy graves for them in the churchyard, and to spend money on their funeral ale into the bargain.<p>So he must and would go and cut Peik off; but Peik had his spies out, and knew when the King was coming, and then he said to his sister,--<p>&#039;Now you must change clothes with me and set off. If you will do that you may have all we have got.&#039;<p>Well! she changed clothes with him, and packed up and started off as fast as she could; but Peik sat all alone in his sister&#039;s clothes.<p>&#039;Where is that Peik?&#039; said the King, as he came in a towering rage through the door.<p>&#039;He has run away,&#039; said Peik.<p>&#039;Ah! had he been at home,&#039; said the King, &#039;I&#039;d have slain him on the spot. It&#039;s no good sparing the life of such a rogue.&#039;<p>&#039;Yes! he knew by his spies that your Majesty was coming, and was going to take his life for his wicked tricks; but he has left me all alone without a morsel of bread or a penny in my purse,&#039; said Peik, who made himself as soft and mealy-mouthed as a young lady.<p>&#039;Come along then to the King&#039;s Grange, and you shall have enough to live on. There&#039;s no good sitting here and starving in this cabin by yourself,&#039; said the King.<p>Yes! he was glad to do that; so the King took him with him, and had him taught everything, and treated him as his own daughter, and it was almost as if the King had his three daughters again, for Miss Peik sewed and stitched, and sung and played with the others, and was with them early and late.<p>After a time a king&#039;s son came to look for a wife.<p>&#039;Yes! I have three daughters,&#039; said the King; &#039;it rests with you which you will have?&#039;<p>So he got leave to go up to their bower to make friends with them, and the end was that he liked Miss Peik best, and threw a silk kerchief into her lap as a love token. So they set to work to get ready the bridal feast, and in a little while his kinsfolk came, and the King&#039;s men, and they all fell to feasting and drinking on the bridal eve; but as night was falling Miss Peik daren&#039;t stay longer, but ran away from the King&#039;s Grange, out into the wide world, and the bride was lost; but there was worse behind, for just then both the other princesses felt very queer, and all at once two little princes came travelling into the world, and folk had to break up and go home just as the fun and feasting were highest.<p><br> <br>The King got both wroth and sorrowful, and began to wonder if it wasn&#039;t Peik again that had a finger in this pie.<p>So he mounted his horse and rode out, for he thought it dull work staying at home; but when he got out among the ploughed fields, there sat Peik on a stone playing on a Jews&#039; harp.<p>&#039;What! are you sitting there, Peik?&#039; said the King.<p>&#039;Here I sit, sure enough,&#039; said Peik. &#039;Where else should I sit?"<p>&#039;Now you have cheated me foully, time after time,&#039; said the King; &#039;but now you must come along home with me, and I&#039;ll kill you.&#039;<p>&#039;Well, well,&#039; said Peik, &#039;if it can&#039;t be helped it can&#039;t; I suppose I must go along with you.&#039;<p>When they got home to the King&#039;s Grange, they got ready a cask which Peik was to be put in, and when it was ready they carted it up to a high fell; there he was to lie three days thinking on all the evil he had done, then they were to roll him down the fell into the firth.<p>The third day a rich man passed by, but Peik sat inside the cask and sang,--<p>&#039;To heaven&#039;s bliss and Paradise, To heaven&#039;s bliss and Paradise.<p>&#039;I&#039;d sooner far stay here and not be made an angel.&#039;<p>When the man heard that, he asked what he would take to change places with him.<p>&#039;It ought to be a good sum,&#039; said Peik, &#039;for there wasn&#039;t a coach ready to start for Paradise every day.&#039;<p>So the man said he would give all he had, and so he knocked out the head of the cask and crept into it instead of Peik.<p>&#039;A happy journey,&#039; said the King, when he came to roll him down; &#039;now you&#039;ll go faster to the firth than if you were in a sledge with reindeer; and now it&#039;s all over with you and your fooling rods.&#039;<p>Before the cask was half-way down the fell, there wasn&#039;t a whole stave of it left, nor a limb of him who was inside. But when the King came back to the Grange, Peik was there before him, and sat in the courtyard playing on the Jews&#039; harp.<p>&#039;What! you sitting here, you Peik?&#039;<p>&#039;Yes! here I sit, sure enough; where else should I sit?&#039; said Peik. &#039;Maybe I can get house-room here for all my horses and sheep and money.&#039;<p>&#039;But whither was it that I rolled you that you got all this wealth?&#039; asked the King.<p>&#039;Oh, you rolled me into the firth,&#039; said Peik, &#039;and when I got to the bottom there was more than enough and to spare, both of horses and sheep and of gold and silver. The cattle went about in great flocks, and the gold and silver lay in large heaps as big as houses.&#039;<p>&#039;What will you take to roll me down the same way?&#039; asked the King.<p>&#039;Oh,&#039; said Peik, &#039;it costs little or nothing to do it. Besides, you took nothing from me, and so I&#039;ll take nothing from you either.&#039;<p>So he stuffed the King into a cask and rolled him over, and when he had given him a ride down to the firth for nothing, he went home to the King&#039;s Grange. Then he began to hold his bridal feast with the youngest princess, and afterwards he ruled both land and realm, but he kept his fooling rods to himself, and kept them so well that nothing was ever afterwards heard of Peik and his tricks, but only of OURSELF THE KING.<br>

Silly Matt
Once on a time there was a goody who had a son called Matthew, but he was so stupid that he had no sense for anything, nor would he do much either; and the little he did was always topsy-turvy and never right, and so they never called him anything but &#039;Silly Matt.&#039;<p>All this the goody thought bad; and it was still worse she thought that her son idled about and never turned his hand to anything else than yawning and stretching himself between the four walls.<p>Now close to where they lived ran a great river, and the stream was strong and bad to cross. So, one day, the goody said to the lad, there was no lack of timber there, for it grew almost up to the cottage-wall; he must cut some down and drag it to the bank and try to build a bridge over the river and take toll, and then he would both have something to do and something to live upon besides.<p>Yes! Matt thought so too, for his mother had said it; what she begged him do, he would do. That was safe and sure he said, for what she said must be so and not otherwise. So he hewed down timber and dragged it down and built a bridge. It didn&#039;t go so awfully fast with the work, but at any rate he had his hands full while it went on.<p>When the bridge was ready, the lad was to stand down at its end and take toll of those who wanted to cross, and his mother bade him be sure not to let any one over unless they paid the toll. It was all the same, she said, if it were not always in money. Goods and wares were just as good pay.<p>So the first day came three chaps with each his load of hay, and wanted to cross the bridge.<p>&#039;No! no!&#039; said the lad; &#039;you can&#039;t go over till I&#039;ve taken the toll.&#039;<p>&#039;We&#039;ve nothing to pay it with,&#039; they said.<p>&#039;Well, then! you can&#039;t cross; but it&#039;s all the same, if it isn&#039;t money. Goods will do just as well.&#039;<p>So they gave him each a wisp of hay, and he had as much as would go on a little hand-sledge, and then they had leave to pass over the bridge.<p>Next came a pedlar with his pack, who sold needles and thread, and such like small wares, and he wanted to cross.<p>&#039;You can&#039;t cross, till you have paid the toll,&#039; said the lad.<p>&#039;I&#039;ve nothing to pay it with,&#039; said the pedlar.<p>&#039;You have wares, at any rate.&#039;<p>So the pedlar took out two needles and gave them him, and then he had leave to cross the bridge. As for the needles, the lad stuck them into the hay, and soon set off home.<p>So when he got home, he said, &#039;Now, I have taken the toll, and got something to live on.&#039;<p>&#039;What did you get?&#039; asked the goody.<p>&#039;Oh!&#039; said he, &#039;there came three chaps, each with his load of hay. They each gave me a wisp of hay, so that I got a little sledge-load; and next, I got two needles from a pedlar.&#039;<p>&#039;What did you do with the hay?&#039; asked the goody.<p>&#039;I tried it between my teeth; but it tasted only of grass, so I threw into the river.&#039;<p>&#039;You ought to have spread it out on the byre-floor,&#039; said the goody.<p>&#039;Well! I&#039;ll do that next time, mother,&#039; he said.<p>&#039;And what then did you do with the needles?&#039; said the goody.<p>&#039;I stuck them in the hay!&#039;<p>&#039;Ah!&#039; said his mother. &#039;You are a born fool. You should have stuck them in and out of your cap.&#039;<p>&#039;Well! don&#039;t say another word, mother, and I&#039;ll be sure to do so next time.&#039;<p>Next day, when the lad stood down at the foot of the bridge again, there came a man from the mill with a sack of meal, and wanted to cross.<p>&#039;You can&#039;t cross till you pay the toll,&#039; said the lad.<p>&#039;I&#039;ve no pence to pay it with,&#039; said the man.<p>&#039;Well! You can&#039;t cross,&#039; said the lad; &#039;but goods are good pay.&#039; So he got a pound of meal, and the man had leave to cross.<p>Not long after came a smith, with a horse-pack of smith&#039;s work, and wanted to cross; but it was still the same.<p>&#039;You mustn&#039;t cross till you&#039;ve paid the toll,&#039; said the lad. But he too had no money either; so he gave the lad a gimlet, and then he had leave to cross.<p>So when the lad got home to his mother, the toll was the first thing she asked about.<p>&#039;What did you take for toll to-day?&#039;<p>&#039;Oh! there came a man from the mill with a sack of meal, and he gave me a pound of meal; and then came a smith, with a horse-load of smith&#039;s-work, and he gave me a gimlet.&#039;<p>&#039;And pray what did you do with the gimlet?&#039; asked the goody.<p>&#039;I did as you bade me, mother,&#039; said the lad. &#039;I stuck it in and out of my cap.&#039;<p>&#039;Oh! but that was silly,&#039; said the goody; &#039;you oughtn&#039;t to have stuck it out and in your cap; but you should have stuck it up your shirt-sleeve.&#039;<p>&#039;Ay! ay! only be still, mother; and I&#039;ll be sure to do it next time.&#039;<p>&#039;And what did you do with the meal, I&#039;d like to know?&#039; said the goody.<p>&#039;Oh! I did as you bade me, mother. I spread it over the byre-floor.&#039;<p>&#039;Never heard anything so silly in my born days,&#039; said the goody; &#039;why, you ought to have gone home for a pail and put it into it.&#039;<p>&#039;Well! well! only be still, mother,&#039; said the lad; &#039;and I&#039;ll be sure to do it next time.&#039;<p>Next day the lad was down at the foot of the bridge to take toll, and so there came a man with a horse-load of brandy, and wanted to cross.<p>&#039;You can&#039;t cross till you pay the toll,&#039; said the lad.<p>&#039;I&#039;ve got no money,&#039; said the man.<p>&#039;Well, then, you can&#039;t cross; but you have goods, of course;&#039; said the lad. Yes; so he got half a quart of brandy, and that he poured up his shirt-sleeve.<p>A while after came a man with a drove of goats, and wanted to cross the bridge.<p>&#039;You can&#039;t cross till you pay the toll,&#039; said the lad.<p>Well! he was no richer than the rest. He had no money; but still he gave the lad a little billy-goat, and he got over with his drove. But the lad took the goat and trod it down into a bucket he had brought with him. So when he got home, the goody asked again--<p>&#039;What did you take to-day?&#039;<p>&#039;Oh! there came a man with a load of brandy, and from him I got a pint of brandy.&#039;<p>&#039;And what did you do with it?&#039;<p>&#039;I did as you bade me, mother; I poured it up my shirt-sleeve.&#039;<p>&#039;Ay! but that was silly, my son; you should have come home to fetch a bottle and poured it into it.&#039;<p>&#039;Well! well! be still this time, mother, and I&#039;ll be sure to do what you say next time,&#039; and then he went on--<p>&#039;Next came a man with a drove of goats, and he gave me a little billy-goat, and that I trod down into the bucket.&#039;<p>&#039;Dear me!&#039; said his mother, &#039;that was silly, and sillier than silly, my son; you should have twisted a withy round its neck, and led the billy-goat home by it.&#039;<p>&#039;Well! be still, mother, and see if I don&#039;t do as you say next time.&#039;<p>Next day he set off for the bridge again to take toll, and so a man came with a load of butter, and wanted to cross. But the lad said &#039;he couldn&#039;t cross unless he paid toll.&#039;<p>&#039;I&#039;ve nothing to pay it with,&#039; said the man.<p>&#039;Well! then you can&#039;t cross,&#039; said the lad; &#039;but you have goods, and I&#039;ll take them instead of money.&#039;<p>So the man gave him a pat of butter, and then he had leave to cross the bridge, and the lad strode off to a grove of willows and twisted a withy, and twined it round the butter, and dragged it home along the road; but so long as he went he left some of the butter behind him, and when he got home there was none left.<p>&#039;And what did you take to-day?&#039; asked his mother.<p>&#039;There came a man with a load of butter, and he gave a pat.&#039;<p>&#039;Butter!&#039; said the goody, &#039;where is it?&#039;<p>&#039;I did as you bade me, mother,&#039; said the lad. &#039;I tied a withy round the pat and led it home; but it was all lost by the way.&#039;<p>&#039;Oh!&#039; said the goody, &#039;you were born a fool, and you&#039;ll die a fool. Now you are not one bit better off for all your toil; but had you been like other folk, you might have had both meat and brandy, and both hay and tools. If you don&#039;t know better how to behave, I don&#039;t know what&#039;s to be done with you. Maybe, you might be more like the rest of the world, and get some sense into you if you were married to some one who could settle things for you, and so I think you had better set off and see about finding a brave lass; but you must be sure you know how to behave well on the way and to greet folk prettily when you meet them.&#039;<p>&#039;And pray what shall I say to them?&#039; asked the lad.<p>&#039;To think of your asking that,&#039; said his mother. &#039;Why, of course, you must bid them "God&#039;s Peace," Don&#039;t you know that?&#039;<p>&#039;Yes! yes! I&#039;ll do as you bid,&#039; said the lad; and so he set off on his way to woo him a wife.<p>So, when he had gone a bit of the way, he met Greylegs, the wolf, with her seven cubs; and when he got so far as to be alongside them, he stood still and greeted them with &#039;God&#039;s Peace!&#039; and when he had said that, he went home again.<p>&#039;I said it all as you bade me, mother,&#039; said Matt.<p>&#039;And what was that?&#039; asked his mother.<p>&#039;God&#039;s Peace,&#039; said Matt.<p>&#039;And pray whom did you meet?&#039;<p>&#039;A she wolf with seven cubs; that was all I met,&#039; said Matt.<p>&#039;Ay! ay! You are like yourself,&#039; said his mother. &#039;So it was, and so it will ever be. Why in the world did you say "God&#039;s Peace" to a wolf. You should have clapped your hands and said--"Huf! huf! you jade of a she-wolf!" That&#039;s what you ought to have said.&#039;<p>&#039;Well! well! be still, mother,&#039; he said. &#039;I&#039;ll be sure to say so another time;&#039; and with that he strode off from the farm, and when he had gone a bit on the way, he met a bridal train. So he stood still when he had got well up to the bride and bridegroom, and clapped his hands and said: &#039;Huf! huf! you jade of a she-wolf!&#039; After that he went home to his mother and said--<p>&#039;I did as you bade me mother; but I got a good thrashing for it, that I did.&#039;<p>&#039;What was it you did?&#039; she asked.<p>&#039;Oh! I clapped my hands and called out, "Huf! huf! you jade of a she-wolf!"&#039;<p>&#039;And what was it you met?&#039;<p>&#039;I met a bridal train.&#039;<p>&#039;Ah! you are a fool, and always will be a fool,&#039; said his mother. &#039;Why should you say such things to a bridal train. You should have said, "Ride happily, bride and bridegroom."&#039;<p>&#039;Well! well! See if I don&#039;t say so next time,&#039; said the lad, and off he went again.<p>So he met a bear, who was taking a ride on a horse, and Matt waited till he came alongside him, and then he said &#039;A happy ride to you, bride and bridegroom,&#039; and then he went back to his mother and told her how he had said what she bade him.<p>&#039;And pray! what was it you said?&#039; she asked.<p>&#039;I said, &#039;A happy ride to you both, bride and bridegroom.&#039;<p>&#039;And whom did you meet?&#039;<p>&#039;I met a bear taking a ride on a horse,&#039; said Matt.<p>&#039;My goodness! what a fool you are,&#039; said his mother. &#039;You ought to have said, "To the de&#039;il with you." That&#039;s what you ought to have said.&#039;<p>&#039;Well! well! mother. I&#039;ll be sure to say so next time.&#039;<p>So he set off again, and this time he met a funeral; and when he had come well up to the coffin, he greeted it and said, &#039;To the de&#039;il with you!&#039; and then he ran home to his mother, and told her he had said what she bade him.<p>&#039;And what was that?&#039; she asked.<p>&#039;Oh! I said, &#039;To the de&#039;il with you."&#039;<p>&#039;And what was it you met?&#039;<p>&#039;I met a funeral,&#039; said Matt; &#039;but I got more kicks than halfpence!&#039;<p>&#039;You didn&#039;t get half enough,&#039; said the goody. &#039;Why, of course, you ought to have said, "May your poor soul have mercy." That&#039;s what you ought to have said.&#039;<p>Ay! ay! mother! so I will next time, only be still,&#039; said Matt, and off he went again.<p>So when he had gone a bit of the way he fell on two ugly gipsies who were skinning a dog. So when he came up to them he greeted them and said, &#039;May your poor soul have mercy,&#039; and when he had said so he went home and told his mother he had said what she bade him; but all he got was such a drubbing he could scarce drag one leg after the other.<p>&#039;But what was it you said?&#039; asked the goody.<p>&#039;May your poor soul have mercy; that was what I said.&#039;<p>&#039;And whom did you meet?&#039;<p>&#039;A pair of gipsies skinning a dog,&#039; he said.<p>&#039;Well! well!&#039; said the goody. &#039;There&#039;s no hope of your changing. You&#039;ll always be a shame and sorrow to us wherever you go. I never heard such shocking words. But now, you must set out and take no notice of any one you meet, for you must be off to woo a wife, and see if you can get some one who knows more of the ways of the world and has a better head on her shoulders than yours. And now you must behave like other folk, and if all goes well you may bless your stars, and bawl out, Hurrah!&#039;<p>Yes, the lad did all that his mother bade him. He set off and wooed a lass, and she thought he couldn&#039;t be so bad a fellow after all; and so she said, &#039;Yes, she would have him.&#039;<p>When the lad got home the goody wanted to know what his sweetheart&#039;s name was; but he did not know. So the goody got angry and said, he must just set off again, for she would know what the girl&#039;s name was. So when Matt was going home again he had sense enough to ask her what she was called. &#039;Well,&#039; she said, &#039;my name is Solvy; but I thought you knew it already.&#039;<p>So Matt ran off home, and as he went he mumbled to himself,<p><br>&#039;Solvy, Solvy,<br>Is my darling!<br>Solvy, Solvy,<br>Is my darling?&#039;<p><br>But just as he was running as hard as he could to reach home before he forgot it, he tripped over a tuft of grass, and forgot the name again. So when he got on his feet again he began to search all round the hillock, but all he could find was a spade. So he seized it and began to dig and search as hard as he could, and as he was hard at it up came an old man.<p>&#039;What are you digging for?&#039; said the man. &#039;Have you lost anything here?&#039;<p>&#039;Oh yes! oh yes! I have lost my sweetheart&#039;s name, and I can&#039;t find it again.&#039;<p>&#039;I think her name is Solvy,&#039; said the man.<p>&#039;Oh yes, that&#039;s it,&#039; said Matt, and away he ran with the spade in his hand, bawling out,<p><br>&#039;Solvy, Solvy,<br>Is my darling!&#039;<p><br>But when he had gone a little way he called to mind that he had taken the spade, and so he threw it behind him, right on to the man&#039;s leg. Then the man began to roar and bemoan himself as though he had a knife stuck in him, and then Matt forgot the name again, and ran home as fast as he could, and when he got there, the first thing his mother asked was--<p>&#039;What&#039;s your sweetheart&#039;s name?&#039;<p>But Matt was just as wise as when he set out, for he did not know the name any better the last than the first time.<p>&#039;You are the same big fool, that you are,&#039; said the goody. &#039;You won&#039;t do any better this time either. But now I&#039;ll just set off myself and fetch the girl home, and get you married. Meanwhile you must fetch water up to the fifth plank all round the room, and wash it, and then you must take a little fat and a little lean, and the greenest thing you can find in the cabbage garden, and boil them all up together; and when you have done that you must put yourself into fine feather, and look smart when your lassie comes, and then you may sit down on the dresser.&#039;<p>Yes, all that Matt thought he could do very well. He fetched water and dashed it about the room in floods, but he couldn&#039;t get it to stand above the fourth plank, for when it rose higher it ran out. So he had to leave off that work. But now you must know, they had a dog whose name was &#039;Fat,&#039; and a cat whose name was &#039;Lean;&#039; both these he took and put into the soup-kettle. As for the greenest thing in the garden, it was a green gown which the goody had meant for her daughter-in-law; that he cut up into little bits, and away it went into the pot; but their little pig, which was called &#039;All,&#039; he cooked by himself in the brewing tub. And when Matt had done all this he laid hands on a pot of treacle and and a feather pillow. Then he first of all rubbed himself all over with the treacle, and then he tore open the pillow and rolled himself in the feathers, and then he sat down on the dresser out in the kitchen, till his mother and the lassie came.<p>Now the first thing the goody missed when she came to her house was the dog, for it always used to meet her out of doors. The next thing was the cat, for it always met her in the porch, and when the weather was right down good and the sun shone, she even came out into the yard, and met her at the garden gate. Nor could she see the green gown she had meant for her daughter-in-law either, and her piggy-wiggy, which followed her grunting wherever she went, he was not there either. So she went in to see about all this; but as soon as ever she lifted the latch, out poured the water through the doorway like a waterfall, so that they were almost borne away by the flood, both the goody and the lassie.<p>So they had to go round by the back door, and when they got inside the kitchen there sat that figure of fun all befeathered.<p>&#039;What have you done?&#039; said the goody.<p>&#039;I did just as you bade me, mother,&#039; said Matt. &#039;I tried to get the water up to the fifth plank, but as fast as ever I poured it in it ran out again, and so I could only get up as high as the fourth plank.&#039;<p>&#039;Well! well! but "Fat" and "Lean," said the goody, who wished to turn it off; &#039;what have you done with them?&#039;<p>&#039;I did as you bade me, mother,&#039; said Matt. &#039;I took and put them into the soup-kettle. They both scratched and bit, and they mewed and whined, and Fat was strong and kicked against it; but he had to go in at last all the same; and as for "All," he&#039;s cooking by himself in the brewing tub in the brew-house, for there wasn&#039;t room for him in the soup-kettle.&#039;<p>&#039;But what have you done with that new green gown I meant for my daughter-in-law?&#039; said the goody, trying to hide his silliness.<p>&#039;Oh! I did as you bade me, mother. It hung out in the cabbage-garden, and as it was the greatest thing there, I took it and cut it up small, and yonder it boils in the soup.&#039;<p>Away ran the goody to the chimney-corner, tore off the pot and turned it upside down with all that was in it. Then she filled it anew and put it on to boil. But when she had time to look at Matt she was quite shocked.<p>&#039;Why is it you are such a figure?&#039; she cried.<p>&#039;I did as you bade me, mother,&#039; said Matt. &#039;First I rubbed myself all over with treacle to make myself sweet for my bride, and then I tore open the pillow and put myself into fine feathers.&#039;<p>Well, the goody turned it off as well as she could, and picked off the feathers from her son, and washed him clean, and put fresh clothes on him.<p>So at last they were to have the wedding, but first Matt was to go to the town and sell a cow to buy things for the bridal. The goody had told him what he was to do, and the beginning and end of what she said was, he was to be sure to get something for the cow. So when he got to the market with the cow, and they asked what he was to have for her, they could get no other answer out of him than that he was to have something for her. So at last came a butcher, who begged him to take the cow and follow him home, and he&#039;d be sure to give him something for her. Yes, Matt went off with the cow, and when he got to the butcher&#039;s house the butcher spat into the palm of Matt&#039;s hand, and said--<p>&#039;There, you have something for your cow, but look sharp after it.&#039;<p>So off went Matt as carefully as if he trode on eggs, holding his hand shut; but when he had got about as far as the cross-road, which led to their farm, he met the parson, who came driving along.<p>&#039;Open the gate for me, my lad,&#039; said the parson.<p>So the lad hastened to open the gate, but in doing so he forgot what he had in his palm, and took the gate by both hands, so that what he got for the cow was left sticking on the gate. So when he saw it was gone he got cross, and said, his reverence had taken something from him.<p>But when the parson asked him if he had lost his wits, and said he had taken nothing from him, Matt got so wrath he killed the parson at a blow, and buried him in a bog by the wayside.<p>So when he got home he told his mother all about it, and she slaughtered a billy-goat, and laid it where Matt had laid the parson, but she buried the parson in another place. And when she had done that she hung over the fire a pot of brose, and when it was cooked she made Matt sit down in the ingle and split matches. Meantime she went up on the roof with the pot and poured the brose down the chimney, so that it streamed over her son.<p>Next day came the sheriff. So when the sheriff asked him, Matt did not gainsay that he had slain the parson, and more, he was quite ready to show the sheriff where he had laid &#039;his reverence.&#039; But when the sheriff asked on what day it happened, Matt said &#039;it was the day when it rained brose over the whole world.&#039;<p>So when he got to the spot where he had buried the parson the sheriff pulled out the billy-goat, and asked--<p>&#039;Had your parson horns?&#039;<p>Now when the judges heard the story, they made up their minds that the lad was quite out of his wits, and so he got off scot free.<p>So after all the bridal was to stand, and the goody had a long talk with her son, and bade him be sure to behave prettily when they sat at table. He was not to look too much at the bride, but to cast an eye at her now and then. Peas he might eat by himself, but he must share the eggs with her, and he was not to lay the leg bones by his side on the table, but to place them tidily on his plate.<p>Yes, Matt would do all that, and he did it well; yes, he did all that his mother bade him, and nothing else. First, he stole out to the sheepfold, and plucked the eyes out of all the sheep and goats he could find, and took them with him. So when they went to dinner he sat with his back to his bride; but all at once he cast a sheep&#039;s eye at her so that it hit her full in her face; and a little while after he cast another, and so he went on. As for the eggs he ate them all up to his own cheek, so that the lassie did not get a taste, but when the peas came he shared them with her. And when they had eaten a while Matt put his feet together, and up on his plate went his legs.<p>At night, when they were to go to bed, the lassie was tired and weary, for she thought it no good to have such a fool for her husband. So she said she had forgotten something and must go out a little; but she could not get Matt&#039;s leave; he would follow her, for to tell the truth, he was afraid she would never come back.<p>&#039;No! no! lie still, I say,&#039; said the bride. &#039;See, here&#039;s a long hair-rope; tie it round me, and I&#039;ll leave the door ajar. So if you think I&#039;m too long away you have only to pull the rope and then you&#039;ll drag me in again.&#039;<p>Yes, Matt was content with that; but as soon as the lassie got out into the yard she caught a billy-goat and untied the rope and tied it round him.<p>So when Matt thought she was too long out of doors he began to haul in the rope, and so he dragged the billy-goat up into bed to him. But when he had lain a while, he bawled out--<p>&#039;Mother! mother! my bride has horns like a billy-goat!&#039;<p>&#039;Stuff! silly boy to lie and bewail yourself,&#039; said his mother. &#039;It&#039;s only her hair-plaits, poor thing, I&#039;m sure.&#039;<p>In a little while Matt called out again--<p>&#039;Mother! mother! my bride has a beard like a goat.&#039;<p>&#039;Stuff! silly boy to lie there and rave,&#039; said the goody.<p>But there was no rest in that house that night, for in a little while Matt screeched out that his bride was like a billy-goat all over. So when it grew towards morning the goody said--<p>&#039;Jump up, my son, and make a fire.&#039;<p>So Matt climbed up to a shelf under the roof, and set fire to some straw and chips, and other rubbish that lay there. But then such a smoke rose, that he couldn&#039;t bear it any longer indoors. He was forced to go out, and just then the day broke. As for the goody, she too had to make a start of it, and when they got out the house was on fire, so that the flames came right out at the roof.<p>&#039;Good luck! good luck! Hip, hip, hurrah!&#039; roared out Matt, for he thought it fine fun to have such an ending to his bridal feast.<br>

Silly Men And Cunning Wives
Once on a time there were two Goodies, who quarrelled, as women often will; and when they had nothing else to quarrel about, they fell to fighting about their husbands, as to which was the silliest of them. The longer they strove the worse they got, and at last they had almost come to pulling caps about it, for, as every one knows, it is easier to begin than to end, and it is a bad look out when wit is wanting. At last, one of them said there was nothing she could not get her husband to believe, if she only said it, for he was as easy as a Troll. Then the other said there was nothing so silly that she could not get her husband to do, if she only said it must be done, for he was such a fool, he could not tell B from a bull&#039;s foot.<p>&#039;Well! let us put it to the proof, which of us can fool them best, and then we&#039;ll see which is the silliest.&#039; That was what they said once, and so it was settled.<p>Now when the first husband, Master Northgrange came home from the wood, his goody said--<p>&#039;Heaven help us both! what is the matter! you are surely ill, if you are not at death&#039;s door?&#039;<p>&#039;Nothing ails me but want of meat and drink,&#039; said the man.<p>&#039;Now, Heaven be my witness!&#039; screamed out the wife, &#039;it gets worse and worse. You look just like a corpse in face; you must go to bed! Dear! dear! this never can last long!&#039; And so she went on till she got her husband to believe he was hard at death&#039;s door, and she put him to bed; and then she made him fold his hands on his breast, and shut his eyes; and so she stretched his limbs, and laid him out, and put him into a coffin; but that he might not be smothered while he lay there, she had some holes made in the sides, so that he could breathe and peep out.<p>The other goody, she took a pair of carding combs, and began to card wool; but she had no wool on them. In came the man, and saw this tomfoolery.<p>&#039;There&#039;s no use,&#039; he said, &#039;in a wheel without wool; but carding combs, without wool, is work for a fool.&#039;<p>&#039;Without wool!&#039; said the goody; &#039;I have wool, only you can&#039;t see it; it&#039;s of the fine sort.&#039; So, when she had carded it all, she took her wheel, and fell a-spinning.<p>&#039;Nay! nay! this is all labour lost!" said the man. &#039;There you sit, wearing out your wheel, as it spins and hums, and all the while you&#039;ve nothing on it.&#039;<p>&#039;Nothing on it!&#039; said the goody; &#039;the thread is so fine, it takes better eyes than yours to see it, that&#039;s all.&#039;<p>So, when her spinning was over, she set up her loom, and put the woof in, and threw the shuttle, and wove cloth. Then she took it out of the loom and pressed it and cut it out, and sewed a new suit of clothes for her husband out of it, and when it was ready, she hung the suit up in the linen closet. As for the man, he could see neither cloth nor clothes; but as he had once for all got it into his head that it was too fine for him to see, he went on saying, &#039;Aye, aye, I understand it all, it is so fine because it is so fine.&#039;<p>Well! in a day or two his goody said to him,<p>&#039;To-day you must go to a funeral. Farmer Northgrange is dead, and they bury him to-day, and so you had better put on your new clothes.&#039;<p>&#039;Yes, very true, he must go to the funeral;&#039; and she helped him on with his new suit, for it was so fine, he might tear it asunder if he put it on alone.<p>So when he came up to the farm, where the funeral was to be, they had all drank hard and long, and you may fancy their grief was not greater when they saw him come in in his new suit. But when the train set off for the churchyard, and the dead man peeped through the breathing holes, he burst out into a loud fit of laughter.<p>&#039;Nay! nay!&#039; he said, &#039;I can&#039;t help laughing, though it is my funeral, for if there isn&#039;t Olof Southgrange walking to my funeral stark naked!&#039;<p>When the bearers heard that, they were not slow in taking the lid off the coffin, and the other husband, he in the new suit, asked how it was that he, over whom they had just drank his funeral ale, lay there in his coffin and chatted and laughed, when it would be more seemly if he wept.<p>&#039;Ah!&#039; said the other; &#039;you know tears never yet dug up any one out of his grave--that&#039;s why I laughed myself to life again.&#039;<p>But the end of all their talk was that it came out that their goodies had played them those tricks. So the husbands went home, and did the wisest thing either of them had done for a long time; and if any one wishes to know what it was, he had better go and ask the birch cudgel.<br>

The Charcoal-burner
Once on a time there was a charcoal-burner, who had a son, who was a charcoal-burner too. When the father was dead, the son took him a wife; but he was lazy and would turn his hand to nothing. He was careless in minding his pits too, and the end was no one would have him to burn charcoal for them.<p>It so fell out that one day he had burned a pit full for himself, and set off to the town with a few loads and sold them; and when he had done selling, he loitered in the street and looked about him. On his way home he fell in with townsmen and neighbours, and made merry, and drank, and chattered of all he had seen in the town. &#039;The prettiest thing I saw,&#039; he said, &#039;was a great crowd of priests, and all the folks greeted them and took off their hats to them. I only wish I were a priest myself; then maybe they would take off their hats to me too. As it was they looked as though they did not even see me at all.&#039;<p>&#039;Well, well!&#039; said his friends, &#039;if you are nothing else, you can&#039;t say you&#039;re not as black as a priest. And now we are about it, we can go to the sale of the old priest, who is dead, and have a glass, and meanwhile you can buy his gown and hood.&#039; That was what the neighbours said; and what they said he did, and when he got home he had not so much as a penny left.<p>&#039;Now you have both means and money, I dare say,&#039; said his goody, when she heard he had sold his charcoal.<p>&#039;I should think so. Means, indeed!&#039; said the charcoal-burner, &#039;for you must know I have been ordained priest. Here you see both gown and hood.&#039;<p>&#039;Nay, I&#039;ll never believe that,&#039; said the goody, &#039;strong ale makes big words. You are just as bad, whichever end of you turns up. That you are,&#039; she said.<p>&#039;You shall neither scold nor sorrow for the pit, for its last coal is quenched and cold,&#039; said the charcoal-burner.<p>It fell out one day that many people in priests&#039; robes passed by the charcoal-burner&#039;s cottage on their way to the king&#039;s palace, so that it was easy to see there was something in the wind there. Yes! the charcoal-burner would go too, and so he put on his gown and hood.<p>His goody thought it would be far better to stay at home; for even if he chanced to hold a horse for some great man, the drink-money he got would only go down his throat like so many before it.<p>&#039;There are many, mother, who talk of drink,&#039; said the man, &#039;who never think of thirst. All I know is, the more one drinks the more one thirsts;&#039; and with that he set off for the palace. When he got there, all the strangers were bidden to come in, and the charcoal-burner followed with the rest. So the king made them a speech, and said he had lost his costliest ring, and was quite sure it had been stolen. That was why he had summoned all the learned priests in the land, to see if there were one of them who could tell him who the thief was. And he made a vow there and then, and said what reward he would give to the man who found out the thief. If he were a curate, he should have a living; if he was a rector, he should be made a dean; if he were a dean, he should be made a bishop; and if he were a bishop, he should become the first man in the kingdom after the king.<p>So the king went round and round among them all, from one to the other, asking them if they could find the thief; and when he came to the charcoal-burner, he said,<p>&#039;Who are you?&#039;<p>&#039;I am the wise priest and the true prophet,&#039; said the charcoal-burner.<p>&#039;Then you can tell me,&#039; said the king, &#039;who has taken my ring?&#039;<p>&#039;Yes!&#039; said the charcoal-burner; &#039;it isn&#039;t so right against rhyme and reason that what has happened in darkness should come to light; but it isn&#039;t every year that salmon spawn in fir-tree tops. Here have I been a curate for seven years, trying to feed myself and my children, and I haven&#039;t got a living yet. If that thief is to be found out, I must have lots of time and reams of paper; for I must write and reckon, and track him out through many lands.&#039;<p>&#039;Yes! he should have as much time and paper as he chose, if he would only lay his finger on the thief.&#039;<p>So they shut him up by himself in a room in the king&#039;s palace, and it was not long before they found out that he must know much more than his Lord&#039;s Prayer; for he scribbled over so much paper that it lay in great heaps and rolls, and yet there was not a man who could make out a word of what he wrote, for it looked like nothing else than pot-hooks and hangers. But, as he did this, time went on, and still there was not a trace of the thief. At last the king got weary, and so he said, if the priest couldn&#039;t find the thief in three days he should lose his life.<p>&#039;More haste, worse speed. You can&#039;t cart coal till the pit is cool,&#039; said the charcoal-burner. But the king stuck to his word--that he did; and the charcoal-burner felt his life wasn&#039;t worth much.<p>Now there were three of the king&#039;s servants who waited on the charcoal-burner day by day, in turn, and these three fellows had stolen the ring between them. So when one of these servants came into the room and cleared the table when he had eaten his supper, and was going out again, the charcoal-burner heaved a deep sigh as he looked after him, and said,<p>&#039;THERE GOES THE FIRST OF THEM!&#039; but he only meant the first of the three days he had still to live.<p>&#039;That priest knows more than how to fill his mouth,&#039; said the servant, when he was alone with his fellows; for he said, I was the first of them.&#039;<p>The next day, the second servant was to mark what the prisoner said when he waited on him, and sure enough when he went out, after clearing the table, the charcoal-burner stared him full in the face and fetched a deep sigh, and said,<p>&#039;THERE GOES THE SECOND OF THEM!&#039;<p>So the third was to take heed to what the charcoal-burner said on the third day, and it was all worse and no better; for when the servant had his hand on the door as he went out with the plates and dishes, the charcoal-burner clasped his hands together, and said, with a sigh as though his heart would break,<p>&#039;THERE GOES THE THIRD OF THEM!&#039;<p>So the man went down to his fellows with his heart in his throat, and said it was clear as day the priest knew all about it; and so they all three went into his room and fell on their knees before him, and begged and prayed he would not say it was they who had stolen the ring. If he would do this, they were ready to give him, each of them, a hundred dollars, if he would not bring them into trouble.<p>Well, he gave his word, like a man, to do that and keep them harmless, if they would only give him the money and the ring and a great bowl of porridge. And what do you think he did with the ring when he got it? Why, he stuffed it well down into the porridge, and bade them go and give it to the biggest pig in the king&#039;s stye.<p>Next morning the king came, and was in no mood for jokes, and said he must know all about the thief.<p>&#039;Well! well! now I have written and reckoned all the world round,&#039; said the charcoal-burner, &#039;but it is no child of man that stole your majesty&#039;s ring.&#039;<p>&#039;Pooh!&#039; said the king; &#039;who was it, then?&#039;<p>&#039;It was the biggest pig in your stye,&#039; said the charcoal-burner.<p>Yes! they killed the pig, and there the ring was inside it; there was no mistake about that; and so the charcoal-burner got a living, and the king was so glad he gave him a farm and a horse, and a hundred dollars into the bargain.<p>You may fancy the charcoal-burner was not slow in flitting to the living, and the first Sunday after he got there he was going to church to read himself in; but before he left his house he was to have his breakfast, and so he took the king&#039;s letter and laid it on a bit of dry toast and then, by mistake, he dipped both toast and letter into his brose, and when he found it tough to chew, he gave the whole morsel to his dog Tray, and Tray gobbled up both toast and letter.<p>And now he scarce knew what to do, or how to turn. To church he must, for the people were waiting; and when he got there, he went straight up into the pulpit. In the pulpit he put on such a grave face that all thought he was a grand priest; but as the service went on, it was not so good after all. This was how he began:<p>&#039;The words, my brethren, which you should have heard this day have gone, alas! to the dogs; but come next Sunday, dear parishioners, and you shall hear something else; and so this sermon comes to an end. Amen!&#039;<p>All the parish thought they had got a strange priest, for they had never heard such a funny sermon before; but still they said to themselves, &#039;He&#039;ll be better perhaps by-and-by, and if he isn&#039;t better we shall know how to deal with him.&#039;<p>Next Sunday, when there was service again, the church was so crowded full with folk who wished to hear the new priest that there was scarce standing-room. Well, he came again, and went straight up into the pulpit, and there he stood awhile and said never a word. But all at once he burst out, and bawled at the top of his voice--<p>&#039;Hearken to me, old Nannygoat Bridget! Why in the world do you sit so far back in the church?&#039;<p>&#039;Oh, your reverence,&#039; said she, &#039;if you must know, it&#039;s because my shoes are all in holes.&#039;<p>&#039;That&#039;s no reason; for you might take an old bit of pig-skin and stitch yourself new shoes, and then you could also come far forward in the church, like the other fine ladies. For the rest, you all ought to bethink yourselves of the way you are going; for I see when ye come to church, some of you come from the north and some from the south, and it is the same when you go from church again. But sometimes ye stand and loiter on the way, and then it may well be asked, What will become of you? Yea! who can tell what will become of every one of us? By the way, I have to give notice of a black mare which has strayed from the old priest&#039;s widow. She has hair on her fetlocks and a falling mane, and other marks which I will not name in this place. Besides, I may tell you, I have a hole in my old breeches-pocket, and I know it, but you do not know it; and another thing you do not know, and which I do not know, is whether any of you has a bit of cloth to patch that hole. Amen.&#039;<p>Some few of the hearers were very well pleased with this sermon. They thought it sure he would make a brave priest in time; but, to tell the truth, most of them thought it too bad, and when the dean came they complained of the priest, and said no one had ever heard such sermons before, and there was even one of them who knew the last by heart, and wrote it down and read it to the dean.<p>&#039;I call it a very good sermon,&#039; said the dean, &#039;for it was likely that he spoke in parables as to seeking light and shunning darkness and its deeds, and as to those who were walking either on the broad or the strait path; but most of all,&#039; he said, &#039;that was a grand parable when he gave that notice about the priest&#039;s black mare, and how it would fare with us all at the last. The pocket with the hole in it was to show the need of the church, and the piece of cloth to patch it was the gifts and offerings of the congregation.&#039; That was what the dean said.<p>As for the parish, what they said was, &#039;Ay! ay!&#039; so much we could understand that it was to go into the priest&#039;s pocket.<p>The end was, the dean said, he thought the parish had got such a good and understanding priest, there was no fault to find with him, and so they had to make the best of him; but after a while, as he got worse instead of better, they complained of him to the bishop.<p>Well! sooner or later the bishop came, and there was to be a visitation. But, the day before, the priest had gone into the church, unbeknown to anybody, and sawed the props of the pulpit all but in two, so that it would only just hang together if one went up into it very carefully. So when the people were gathered together and he was to preach before the bishop, he crept up into the pulpit and began to expound, as he was wont; and when he had gone on a while, he got more in earnest, threw his arms about and bawled out,<p>&#039;If there be any here who is wicked or given to ill deeds, it were better he left this place; for this very day there shall be a fall, such as hath not been seen since the world began.&#039;<p>With that he struck the reading-desk like thunder, and lo! the desk and the priest and the whole pulpit tumbled down on the floor of the church with such a crash that the whole congregation ran out of church, as if Doomsday were at their heels.<p>But then the bishop told the fault-finders he was amazed that they dared to complain of a priest who had such gifts in the pulpit, and so much wisdom that he could foresee things about to happen. For his part, he thought he ought to be a dean at least, and it was not long either before he was a dean. So there was no help for it; they had to put up with him.<p>Now it so happened that the king and queen had no children; but when the king heard that, perhaps, there was one coming, he was eager to know if it would be an heir to his crown and realm, or if it would only be a princess. So all the wise men in the land were gathered to the palace, that they might say beforehand what it would be. But when there was not a man of them that could say that, both the king and the bishop thought of the charcoal-burner, and it was not long before they got him between them, and asked him about it. &#039;No!&#039; he said, &#039;that was past his power, for it was not good to guess at what no man alive could know.&#039;<p>&#039;All very fine, I dare say,&#039; said the king. &#039;It&#039;s all the same to me, of course, if you know it or if you don&#039;t know it; but, you know, you are the wise priest and the true prophet who can foretell things to come; and all I can say is if you don&#039;t tell it me, you shall lose your gown. And now I think of it, I&#039;ll try you first.&#039;<p>So he took the biggest silver tankard he had and went down to the sea-shore, and, in a little while, called the priest.<p>&#039;If you can tell me now what there is in this tankard,&#039; said the king, &#039;you will be able to tell me the other also;&#039; and as he said this, he held the lid of the tankard tight.<p>The charcoal-burner only wrung his hands and bemoaned himself.<p>&#039;Oh! you most wretched crab and cripple on this earth,&#039; he cried out, &#039;this is what all your backslidings and sidelong tricks have brought on you.&#039;<p>&#039;Ah!&#039; cried out the king, &#039;how could you say you did not know?&#039; for you must know he had a crab in the tankard. So the charcoal-burner had to go into the parlour to the queen. He took a chair and sat down in the middle of the floor, while the queen walked up and down in the room.<p>&#039;One should never count one&#039;s chickens before they are hatched, and never quarrel about a baby&#039;s name before it is born,&#039; said the charcoal-burner; &#039;but I never heard or saw such a thing before! When the queen comes toward me, I almost think it will be a prince, and when she goes away from me it looks as if it would be a princess.&#039;<p>Lo! when the time came, it was both a prince and a princess, for twins were born; and so the charcoal-burner had hit the mark that time too. And because he could tell that which no man could know, he got money in carts full, and was the next man to the king in the realm.<p>Trip, trap, trill,<br>A man is often more than he will."<br>

The emperor&#039;s new suit
MANY, many years ago lived an emperor, who thought so much of new clothes that he spent all his money in order to obtain them; his only ambition was to be always well dressed. He did not care for his soldiers, and the theatre did not amuse him; the only thing, in fact, he thought anything of was to drive out and show a new suit of clothes. He had a coat for every hour of the day; and as one would say of a king “He is in his cabinet,” so one could say of him, “The emperor is in his dressing-room.” <p>The great city where he resided was very gay; every day many strangers from all parts of the globe arrived. One day two swindlers came to this city; they made people believe that they were weavers, and declared they could manufacture the finest cloth to be imagined. Their colours and patterns, they said, were not only exceptionally beautiful, but the clothes made of their material possessed the wonderful quality of being invisible to any man who was unfit for his office or unpardonably stupid.<p>“That must be wonderful cloth,” thought the emperor. “If I were to be dressed in a suit made of this cloth I should be able to find out which men in my empire were unfit for their places, and I could distinguish the clever from the stupid. I must have this cloth woven for me without delay.” And he gave a large sum of money to the swindlers, in advance, that they should set to work without any loss of time. They set up two looms, and pretended to be very hard at work, but they did nothing whatever on the looms. They asked for the finest silk and the most precious gold-cloth; all they got they did away with, and worked at the empty looms till late at night.<p>“I should very much like to know how they are getting on with the cloth,” thought the emperor. But he felt rather uneasy when he remembered that he who was not fit for his office could not see it. Personally, he was of opinion that he had nothing to fear, yet he thought it advisable to send somebody else first to see how matters stood. Everybody in the town knew what a remarkable quality the stuff possessed, and all were anxious to see how bad or stupid their neighbours were.<p>“I shall send my honest old minister to the weavers,” thought the emperor. “He can judge best how the stuff looks, for he is intelligent, and nobody understands his office better than he.”<p>The good old minister went into the room where the swindlers sat before the empty looms. “Heaven preserve us!” he thought, and opened his eyes wide, “I cannot see anything at all,” but he did not say so. Both swindlers requested him to come near, and asked him if he did not admire the exquisite pattern and the beautiful colours, pointing to the empty looms. The poor old minister tried his very best, but he could see nothing, for there was nothing to be seen. “Oh dear,” he thought, “can I be so stupid? I should never have thought so, and nobody must know it! Is it possible that I am not fit for my office? No, no, I cannot say that I was unable to see the cloth.”<p>“Now, have you got nothing to say?” said one of the swindlers, while he pretended to be busily weaving.<p>“Oh, it is very pretty, exceedingly beautiful,” replied the old minister looking through his glasses. “What a beautiful pattern, what brilliant colours! I shall tell the emperor that I like the cloth very much.”<p>“We are pleased to hear that,” said the two weavers, and described to him the colours and explained the curious pattern. The old minister listened attentively, that he might relate to the emperor what they said; and so he did.<p>Now the swindlers asked for more money, silk and gold-cloth, which they required for weaving. They kept everything for themselves, and not a thread came near the loom, but they continued, as hitherto, to work at the empty looms.<p>Soon afterwards the emperor sent another honest courtier to the weavers to see how they were getting on, and if the cloth was nearly finished. Like the old minister, he looked and looked but could see nothing, as there was nothing to be seen.<p>“Is it not a beautiful piece of cloth?” asked the two swindlers, showing and explaining the magnificent pattern, which, however, did not exist.<p>“I am not stupid,” said the man. “It is therefore my good appointment for which I am not fit. It is very strange, but I must not let any one know it;” and he praised the cloth, which he did not see, and expressed his joy at the beautiful colours and the fine pattern. “It is very excellent,” he said to the emperor.<p>Everybody in the whole town talked about the precious cloth. At last the emperor wished to see it himself, while it was still on the loom. With a number of courtiers, including the two who had already been there, he went to the two clever swindlers, who now worked as hard as they could, but without using any thread.<p>“Is it not magnificent?” said the two old statesmen who had been there before. “Your Majesty must admire the colours and the pattern.” And then they pointed to the empty looms, for they imagined the others could see the cloth.<p>“What is this?” thought the emperor, “I do not see anything at all. That is terrible! Am I stupid? Am I unfit to be emperor? That would indeed be the most dreadful thing that could happen to me.”<p>“Really,” he said, turning to the weavers, “your cloth has our most gracious approval;” and nodding contentedly he looked at the empty loom, for he did not like to say that he saw nothing. All his attendants, who were with him, looked and looked, and although they could not see anything more than the others, they said, like the emperor, “It is very beautiful.” And all advised him to wear the new magnificent clothes at a great procession which was soon to take place. “It is magnificent, beautiful, excellent,” one heard them say; everybody seemed to be delighted, and the emperor appointed the two swindlers “Imperial Court weavers.”<p>The whole night previous to the day on which the procession was to take place, the swindlers pretended to work, and burned more than sixteen candles. People should see that they were busy to finish the emperor’s new suit. They pretended to take the cloth from the loom, and worked about in the air with big scissors, and sewed with needles without thread, and said at last: “The emperor’s new suit is ready now.”<p>The emperor and all his barons then came to the hall; the swindlers held their arms up as if they held something in their hands and said: “These are the trousers!” “This is the coat!” and “Here is the cloak!” and so on. “They are all as light as a cobweb, and one must feel as if one had nothing at all upon the body; but that is just the beauty of them.”<p>“Indeed!” said all the courtiers; but they could not see anything, for there was nothing to be seen. <p>“Does it please your Majesty now to graciously undress,” said the swindlers, “that we may assist your Majesty in putting on the new suit before the large looking-glass?”<p>The emperor undressed, and the swindlers pretended to put the new suit upon him, one piece after another; and the emperor looked at himself in the glass from every side.<p>“How well they look! How well they fit!” said all. “What a beautiful pattern! What fine colours! That is a magnificent suit of clothes!”<p>The master of the ceremonies announced that the bearers of the canopy, which was to be carried in the procession, were ready.<p>“I am ready,” said the emperor. “Does not my suit fit me marvellously?” Then he turned once more to the looking-glass, that people should think he admired his garments.<p>The chamberlains, who were to carry the train, stretched their hands to the ground as if they lifted up a train, and pretended to hold something in their hands; they did not like people to know that they could not see anything.<p>The emperor marched in the procession under the beautiful canopy, and all who saw him in the street and out of the windows exclaimed: “Indeed, the emperor’s new suit is incomparable! What a long train he has! How well it fits him!” Nobody wished to let others know he saw nothing, for then he would have been unfit for his office or too stupid. Never emperor’s clothes were more admired.<p>“But he has nothing on at all,” said a little child at last. “Good heavens! listen to the voice of an innocent child,” said the father, and one whispered to the other what the child had said. “But he has nothing on at all,” cried at last the whole people. That made a deep impression upon the emperor, for it seemed to him that they were right; but he thought to himself, “Now I must bear up to the end.” And the chamberlains walked with still greater dignity, as if they carried the train which did not exist.<br>

The Father and His Two Daughters
  A MAN had two daughters, the one married to a gardener, and the other to a tile-maker. After a time he went to the daughter who had married the gardener, and inquired how she was and how all things went with her. She said, &quot;All things are prospering with me, and I have only one wish, that there may be a heavy fall of rain, in order that the plants may be well watered.&quot; Not long after, he went to the daughter who had married the tilemaker, and likewise inquired of her how she fared; she replied, &quot;I want for nothing, and have only one wish, that the dry weather may continue, and the sun shine hot and bright, so that the bricks might be dried.&quot; He said to her, &quot;If your sister wishes for rain, and you for dry weather, with which of the two am I to join my wishes?&#039;

The Honest Penny
Once on a time there was a poor woman who lived in a tumble-down hut far away in the wood. Little had she to eat, and nothing at all to burn, and so she sent a little boy she had out into the wood to gather fuel. He ran and jumped, and jumped and ran, to keep himself warm, for it was a cold gray autumn day, and every time he found a bough or a root for his billet, he had to beat his arms across his breast, for his fists were as red as the cranberries over which he walked, for very cold. So when he had got his billet of wood and was off home, he came upon a clearing of stumps on the hillside, and there he saw a white crooked stone.<p>&#039;Ah! you poor old stone,&#039; said the boy; &#039;how white and wan you are! I&#039;ll be bound you are frozen to death;&#039; and with that he took off his jacket, and laid it on the stone. So when he got home with his billet of wood his mother asked what it all meant that he walked about in wintry weather in his shirtsleeves. Then he told her how he had seen an old crooked stone which was all white and wan for frost, and how he had given it his jacket.<p>&#039;What a fool you are!&#039; said his mother; &#039;do you think a stone can freeze? But even if it froze till it shook again, know this--everyone is nearest to his own self. It costs quite enough to get clothes to your back, without your going and hanging them on stones in the clearings,&#039; and as she said that, she hunted the boy out of the house to fetch his jacket.<p>So when he came where the stone stood, lo! it had turned itself and lifted itself up on one side from the ground. &#039;Yes! yes! this is since you got the jacket, poor old thing,&#039; said the boy.<p>But, when he looked a little closer at the stone, he saw a money-box, full of bright silver, under it.<p>&#039;This is stolen money, no doubt,&#039; thought the boy; &#039;no one puts money, come by honestly, under a stone away in the wood.&#039;<p>So he took the money-box and bore it down to a tarn hard by and threw the whole hoard into the tarn; but one silver pennypiece floated on the top of the water, "&#039;Ah! ah! that is honest,&#039; said the lad; &#039;for what is honest never sinks.&#039;<p>So he took the silver penny and went home with it and his jacket. Then he told his mother how it had all happened, how the stone had turned itself, and how he had found a money-box full of silver money, which he had thrown out into the tarn because it was stolen money, and how one silver penny floated on the top.<p>&#039;That I took,&#039; said the boy, &#039;because it was honest.&#039;<p>&#039;You are a born fool,&#039; said his mother, for she was very angry; &#039;were naught else honest than what floats on water, there wouldn&#039;t be much honesty in the world. And even though the money were stolen ten times over, still you had found it; and I tell you again what I told you before, every one is nearest to his own self. Had you only taken that money we might have lived well and happily all our days. But a ne&#039;er-do-weel thou art, and a ne&#039;er-do-weel thou wilt be, and now I won&#039;t drag on any longer toiling and moiling for thee. Be off with thee into the world and earn thine own bread.&#039;"<p>So the lad had to go out into the wide world, and he went both far and long seeking a place. But wherever he came, folk thought him too little and weak, and said they could put him to no use. At last he came to a merchant, and there he got leave to be in the kitchen and carry in wood and water for the cook. Well, after he had been there a long time, the merchant had to make a journey into foreign lands, and so he asked all his servants what he should buy and bring home for each of them. So, when all had said what they would have, the turn came to the scullion, too, who brought in wood and water for the cook. Then he held out his penny.<p>&#039;Well, what shall I buy with this?&#039; asked the merchant; &#039;there won&#039;t be much time lost over this bargain.&#039;<p>&#039;Buy what I can get for it. It is honest, that I know,&#039; said the lad.<p>That his master gave his word to do, and so he sailed away.<p>So when the merchant had unladed his ship and laded her again in foreign lands, and bought what he had promised his servants to buy, he came down to his ship, and was just going to shove off from the wharf. Then all at once it came into his head that the scullion had sent out a silver penny with him, that he might buy something for him.<p>&#039;Must I go all the way back to the town for the sake of a silver penny? One would then have small gain in taking such a beggar into one&#039;s house,&#039; thought the merchant.<p>Just then an old wife came walking by with a bag at her back.<p>&#039;What have you got in your bag, mother?&#039; asked the merchant.<p>&#039;Oh! nothing else than a cat. I can&#039;t afford to feed it any longer, so I thought I would throw it into the sea, and make away with it,&#039; answered the woman.<p>Then the merchant said to himself, &#039;Didn&#039;t the lad say I was to buy what I could get for his penny?&#039; So he asked the old wife if she would take four farthings for her cat. Yes! the goody was not slow to say &#039;done,&#039; and so the bargain was soon struck.<p>Now when the merchant had sailed a bit, fearful weather fell on him, and such a storm, there was nothing for it but to drive and drive till he did not know whither he was going. At last he came to a land on which he had never set foot before, and so up he went into the town.<p>At the inn where he turned in, the board was laid with a rod for each man who sat at it. The merchant thought it very strange, for he couldn&#039;t at all make out what they were to do with all these rods; but he sate him down, and thought he would watch well what the others did, and do like them. Well! as soon as the meat was set on the board, he saw well enough what the rods meant; for out swarmed mice in thousands, and each one who sate at the board had to take to his rod and flog and flap about him, and naught else could be heard than one cut of the rod harder than the one which went before it. Sometimes they whipped one another in the face, and just gave themselves time to say, &#039;Beg pardon,&#039; and then at it again.<p>&#039;Hard work to dine in this land!&#039; said the merchant. &#039;But don&#039;t folk keep cats here?&#039;<p>&#039;Cats?&#039; they all asked, for they did not know what cats were.<p>So the merchant sent and fetched the cat he had bought for the scullion, and as soon as the cat got on the table, off ran the mice to their holes, and folks had never in the memory of man had such rest at their meat.<p>Then they begged and prayed the merchant to sell them the cat, and at last, after a long, long time, he promised to let them have it; but he would have a hundred dollars for it; and that sum they gave and thanks besides.<p>So the merchant sailed off again; but he had scarce got good sea-room before he saw the cat sitting up at the mainmast head, and all at once again came foul weather and a storm worse than the first, and he drove and drove till he got to a country where he had never been before. The merchant went up to an inn, and here, too, the board was spread with rods; but they were much bigger and longer than the first. And, to tell the truth, they had need to be; for here the mice were many more, and every mouse was twice as big as those he had before seen.<p>So he sold the cat again, and this time he got two hundred dollars for it, and that without any haggling.<p>So when he had sailed away from that land and got a bit out at sea, there sat Grimalkin again at the masthead; and the bad weather began at once again, and the end of it was, he was again driven to a land where he had never been before.<p>He went ashore, up to the town, and turned into an inn. There, too, the board was laid with rods, but every rod was an ell and a half long, and as thick as a small broom; and the folk said that to sit at meat was the hardest trial they had, for there were thousands of big ugly rats, so that it was only with sore toil and trouble one could get a morsel into one&#039;s mouth, &#039;twas such hard work to keep off the rats. So the cat had to be fetched up from the ship once more, and then folks got their food in peace. Then they all begged and prayed the merchant, for heaven&#039;s sake, to sell them his cat. For a long time he said, &#039;No;&#039; but at last, he gave his word to take three hundred dollars for it. That sum they paid down at once, and thanked him and blessed him for it into the bargain.<p>Now, when the merchant got out to sea, he fell a-thinking how much the lad had made out of the penny he had sent out with him.<p>&#039;Yes, yes, some of the money he shall have,&#039; said the merchant to himself; &#039;but not all. Me it is that he has to thank for the cat I bought; and, besides, every man is nearest to his own self.&#039;<p>But as soon as ever the merchant thought this, such a storm and gale arose that every one thought the ship must founder. So the merchant saw there was no help for it, and he had to vow that the lad should have every penny; and, no sooner had he vowed this vow, than the weather turned good, and he got a snoring breeze fair for home.<p>So, when he got to land, he gave the lad the six hundred dollars, and his daughter besides; for now the little scullion was just as rich as his master, the merchant, and even richer; and, after that, the lad lived all his days in mirth and jollity; and he sent for his mother and treated her as well as or better than he treated himself; for, said the lad, &#039;I don&#039;t think that every one is nearest to his own self.&#039;<br>

The Horse and Groom
  A GROOM used to spend whole days in currycombing and rubbing down his Horse, but at the same time stole his oats and sold them for his own profit. &quot;Alas!&quot; said the Horse, &quot;if you really wish me to be in good condition, you should groom me less, and feed me more.&quot;

The Husband Who Was to Mind the House
ONCE on a time there was a man, so surly and cross, he never thought his wife did anything right in the house. So one evening, in hay-making time, he came home, scolding and swearing and showing his teeth and making a dust.<p>"Dear love, don&#039;t be so angry; there&#039;s a good man," said his goody; "to-morrow let&#039;s change our work. I&#039;ll go out with the mowers and mow, and you shall mind the house at home."<p>Yes, the husband thought that would do very well. He was quite willing, he said.<p>So, early next morning, his goody took a scythe over her neck, and went out into the hay-field with the mowers and began to mow; but the man was to mind the house, and do the work at home.<p>First of all he wanted to churn the butter; but when he had churned a while, he got thirsty, and went down to the cellar to tap a barrel of ale. So, just when he had knocked in the bung, and was putting the tap into the cask, he heard overhead the pig come into the kitchen. Then off he ran up the cellar steps, with the tap in his hand, as fast as he could, to look after the pig, lest it should upset the churn; but when he got up, and saw the pig had already knocked the churn over, and stood there, routing and grunting amongst the cream which was running all over the floor, he got so wild with rage that he quite forgot the ale-barrel, and ran at the pig, as hard as he could. He caught it, too, just as it ran out of doors, and gave it such a kick that piggy lay for dead on the spot. Then all at once he remembered he had the tap in his hand; but when he got down to the cellar, every drop of ale had run out of the cask.<p>Then he went into the dairy and found enough cream left to fill the churn again, and so he began to churn, for butter they must have at dinner. When he had churned a bit, he remembered that their milking cow was still shut up in the byre, and hadn&#039;t had a bit to eat or a drop to drink all the morning, though the sun was high. Then all at once he thought &#039;twas too far to take her down to the meadow, so he&#039;d just get her up on the house-top—for the house, you must know, was thatched with sods, and a fine crop of grass was growing there. Now their house lay close up against a steep down, and he thought if he laid a plank across to the thatch at the back he&#039;d easily get the cow up.<p>But still he couldn&#039;t leave the churn, for there was his little babe crawling about on the floor, and "if I leave it," he thought, "the child is safe to upset it." So he took the churn on his back, and went out with it; but then he thought, he&#039;d better first water the cow before he turned her out on the thatch; so he took up a bucket to draw water out of the well; but, as he stooped down at the well&#039;s brink, all the cream ran out of the churn over his shoulders, and so down into the well.<p>Now it was near dinner-time, and he hadn&#039;t even got the butter yet; so he thought he&#039;d best boil the porridge, and filled the pot with water, and hung it over the fire. When he had done that, he thought the cow might perhaps fall off the thatch and break her legs or her neck. So he got up on the house to tie her up. One end of the rope he made fast to the cow&#039;s neck, and the other he slipped down the chimney and tied round his own thigh; and he had to make haste, for the water now began to boil in the pot, and he had still to grind the oatmeal.<p>So he began to grind away; but while he was hard at it, down fell the cow off the house top after all, and as she fell, she dragged the man up the chimney by the rope. There he stuck fast; and as for the cow, she hung, half-way down the wall, swinging between heaven and earth, for she could neither get down nor up.<p>And now the goody had waited seven lengths and seven breadths for her husband to come and call them home to dinner; but never a call they had. At last she thought she&#039;d waited long enough, and went home. But when she got there and saw the cow hanging in such an ugly place, she ran up and cut the rope in two with her scythe. But as she did this, down came her husband out of the chimney; and so when his old dame came inside the kitchen, there she found him standing on his head in the porridge-pot.<br>

The Image of Mercury and the Carpenter
  A VERY POOR MAN, a Carpenter by trade, had a wooden image of Mercury, before which he made offerings day by day, and begged the idol to make him rich, but in spite of his entreaties he became poorer and poorer. At last, being very angry, he took his image down from its pedestal and dashed it against the wall.  When its head was knocked off, out came a stream of gold, which the Carpenter quickly picked up and said, &quot;Well, I think thou art altogether contradictory and unreasonable; for when I paid you honor, I reaped no benefits: but now that I maltreat you I am loaded with an abundance of riches.&quot;

The little peasant
There was a certain village wherein no one lived but really rich peasants, and just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant. He had not even so much as a cow, and still less money to buy one, and yet he and his wife did so wish to have one. One day he said to her, "Hark you, I have a good thought, there is our gossip the carpenter, he shall make us a wooden calf, and paint it brown, so that it look like any other, and in time it will certainly get big and be a cow." The woman also liked the idea, and their gossip the carpenter cut and planed the calf, and painted it as it ought to be, and made it with its head hanging down as if it were eating.<p>Next morning when the cows were being driven out, the little peasant called the cow-herd and said, "Look, I have a little calf there, but it is still small and has still to be carried." The cow-herd said, "All right, and took it in his arms and carried it to the pasture, and set it among the grass." The little calf always remained standing like one which was eating, and the cow-herd said, "It will soon run alone, just look how it eats already!" At night when he was going to drive the herd home again, he said to the calf, "If thou canst stand there and eat thy fill, thou canst also go on thy four legs; I don&#039;t care to drag thee home again in my arms." But the little peasant stood at his door, and waited for his little calf, and when the cow-herd drove the cows through the village, and the calf was missing, he inquired where it was. The cow-herd answered, "It is still standing out there eating. It would not stop and come with us." But the little peasant said, "Oh, but I must have my beast back again." Then they went back to the meadow together, but some one had stolen the calf, and it was gone. The cow-herd said, "It must have run away." The peasant, however, said, "Don&#039;t tell me that," and led the cow-herd before the mayor, who for his carelessness condemned him to give the peasant a cow for the calf which had run away.<p>And now the little peasant and his wife had the cow for which they had so long wished, and they were heartily glad, but they had no food for it, and could give it nothing to eat, so it soon had to be killed. They salted the flesh, and the peasant went into the town and wanted to sell the skin there, so that he might buy a new calf with the proceeds. On the way he passed by a mill, and there sat a raven with broken wings, and out of pity he took him and wrapped him in the skin. As, however, the weather grew so bad and there was a storm of rain and wind, he could go no farther, and turned back to the mill and begged for shelter. The miller&#039;s wife was alone in the house, and said to the peasant, "Lay thyself on the straw there," and gave him a slice of bread with cheese on it. The peasant ate it, and lay down with his skin beside him, and the woman thought, "He is tired and has gone to sleep." In the meantime came the parson; the miller&#039;s wife received him well, and said, "My husband is out, so we will have a feast." The peasant listened, and when he heard about feasting he was vexed that he had been forced to make shift with a slice of bread with cheese on it. Then the woman served up four different things, roast meat, salad, cakes, and wine.<p>Just as they were about to sit down and eat, there was a knocking outside. The woman said, "Oh, heavens! It is my husband!" She quickly hid the roast meat inside the tiled stove, the wine under the pillow, the salad on the bed, the cakes under it, and the parson in the cupboard in the entrance. Then she opened the door for her husband, and said, "Thank heaven, thou art back again! There is such a storm, it looks as if the world were coming to an end." The miller saw the peasant lying on the straw, and asked, "What is that fellow doing there?" - "Ah," said the wife, "the poor knave came in the storm and rain, and begged for shelter, so I gave him a bit of bread and cheese, and showed him where the straw was." The man said, "I have no objection, but be quick and get me something to eat." The woman said, "But I have nothing but bread and cheese." - "I am contented with anything," replied the husband, "so far as I am concerned, bread and cheese will do," and looked at the peasant and said, "Come and eat some more with me." The peasant did not require to be invited twice, but got up and ate. After this the miller saw the skin in which the raven was, lying on the ground, and asked, "What hast thou there?" The peasant answered, "I have a soothsayer inside it." - "Can he foretell anything to me?" said the miller. "Why not?" answered the peasant, "but he only says four things, and the fifth he keeps to himself." The miller was curious, and said, "Let him foretell something for once." Then the peasant pinched the raven&#039;s head, so that he croaked and made a noise like krr, krr. The miller said, "What did he say?" The peasant answered, "In the first place, he says that there is some wine hidden under the pillow." - "Bless me!" cried the miller, and went there and found the wine. "Now go on," said he. The peasant made the raven croak again, and said, "In the second place, he says that there is some roast meat in the tiled stove." - "Upon my word!" cried the miller, and went thither, and found the roast meat. The peasant made the raven prophesy still more, and said, "Thirdly, he says that there is some salad on the bed." - "That would be a fine thing!" cried the miller, and went there and found the salad. At last the peasant pinched the raven once more till he croaked, and said, "Fourthly, he says that there are some cakes under the bed." - "That would be a fine thing!" cried the miller, and looked there, and found the cakes.<p>And now the two sat down to the table together, but the miller&#039;s wife was frightened to death, and went to bed and took all the keys with her. The miller would have liked much to know the fifth, but the little peasant said, "First, we will quickly eat the four things, for the fifth is something bad." So they ate, and after that they bargained how much the miller was to give for the fifth prophesy, until they agreed on three hundred thalers. Then the peasant once more pinched the raven&#039;s head till he croaked loudly. The miller asked, "What did he say?" The peasant replied, "He says that the Devil is hiding outside there in the cupboard in the entrance." The miller said, "The Devil must go out," and opened the house-door; then the woman was forced to give up the keys, and the peasant unlocked the cupboard. The parson ran out as fast as he could, and the miller said, "It was true; I saw the black rascal with my own eyes." The peasant, however, made off next morning by daybreak with the three hundred thalers.<p>At home the small peasant gradually launched out; he built a beautiful house, and the peasants said, "The small peasant has certainly been to the place where golden snow falls, and people carry the gold home in shovels." Then the small peasant was brought before the Mayor, and bidden to say from whence his wealth came. He answered, "I sold my cow&#039;s skin in the town, for three hundred thalers." When the peasants heard that, they too wished to enjoy this great profit, and ran home, killed all their cows, and stripped off their skins in order to sell them in the town to the greatest advantage. The Mayor, however, said, "But my servant must go first." When she came to the merchant in the town, he did not give her more than two thalers for a skin, and when the others came, he did not give them so much, and said, "What can I do with all these skins?"<p>Then the peasants were vexed that the small peasant should have thus overreached them, wanted to take vengeance on him, and accused him of this treachery before the Mayor. The innocent little peasant was unanimously sentenced to death, and was to be rolled into the water, in a barrel pierced full of holes. He was led forth, and a priest was brought who was to say a mass for his soul. The others were all obliged to retire to a distance, and when the peasant looked at the priest, he recognized the man who had been with the miller&#039;s wife. He said to him, "I set you free from the cupboard, set me free from the barrel." At this same moment up came, with a flock of sheep, the very shepherd who as the peasant knew had long been wishing to be Mayor, so he cried with all his might, "No, I will not do it; if the whole world insists on it, I will not do it!" The shepherd hearing that, came up to him, and asked, "What art thou about? What is it that thou wilt not do?" The peasant said, "They want to make me Mayor, if I will but put myself in the barrel, but I will not do it." The shepherd said, "If nothing more than that is needful in order to be Mayor, I would get into the barrel at once." The peasant said, "If thou wilt get in, thou wilt be Mayor." The shepherd was willing, and got in, and the peasant shut the top down on him; then he took the shepherd&#039;s flock for himself, and drove it away. The parson went to the crowd, and declared that the mass had been said. Then they came and rolled the barrel towards the water. When the barrel began to roll, the shepherd cried, "I am quite willing to be Mayor." They believed no otherwise than that it was the peasant who was saying this, and answered, "That is what we intend, but first thou shalt look about thee a little down below there," and they rolled the barrel down into the water.<p>After that the peasants went home, and as they were entering the village, the small peasant also came quietly in, driving a flock of sheep and looking quite contented. Then the peasants were astonished, and said, "Peasant, from whence comest thou? Hast thou come out of the water?" - "Yes, truly," replied the peasant, "I sank deep, deep down, until at last I got to the bottom; I pushed the bottom out of the barrel, and crept out, and there were pretty meadows on which a number of lambs were feeding, and from thence I brought this flock away with me." Said the peasants, "Are there any more there?" - "Oh, yes," said he, "more than I could do anything with." Then the peasants made up their minds that they too would fetch some sheep for themselves, a flock apiece, but the Mayor said, "I come first." So they went to the water together, and just then there were some of the small fleecy clouds in the blue sky, which are called little lambs, and they were reflected in the water, whereupon the peasants cried, "We already see the sheep down below!" The Mayor pressed forward and said, "I will go down first, and look about me, and if things promise well I&#039;ll call you." So he jumped in; splash! went the water; he made a sound as if he were calling them, and the whole crowd plunged in after him as one man. Then the entire village was dead, and the small peasant, as sole heir, became a rich man.

The Man and the Satyr
  A MAN and a Satyr once drank together in token of a bond of alliance being formed between them. One very cold wintry day, as they talked, the Man put his fingers to his mouth and blew on them. When the Satyr asked the reason for this, he told him that he did it to warm his hands because they were so cold. Later on in the day they sat down to eat, and the food prepared was quite scalding. The Man raised one of the dishes a little towards his mouth and blew in it. When the Satyr again inquired the reason, he said that he did it to cool the meat, which was too hot. &quot;I can no longer consider you as a friend,&quot; said the Satyr, &quot;a fellow who with the same breath blows hot and cold.&quot;

The Master Thief
ONCE upon a time there was a poor cottager who had three sons. He had nothing to leave them when he died, and no money with which to put them to any trade, so that he did not know what to make of them. At last he said he would give them leave to take to anything each liked best, and to go whithersoever they pleased, and he would go with them a bit of the way; and so he did. He went with them till they came to a place where three roads met, and there each of them chose a road, and their father bade them good-bye, and went back home. I have never heard tell what became of the two older; but as for the youngest, he went both far and long, as you shall hear.<p>So it fell out one night as he was going through a great wood that such bad weather overtook him. It blew, and sleeted, and drove so that he could scarce keep his eyes open; and in a trice, before he knew how it was, he got bewildered,and could not find either road or path. But as he went on and on, at last he saw a glimmering of light far far off in the wood. So he thought he would try and get to the light; and after a time he did reach it. There it was in a large house, and the fire was blazing so brightly inside that he could tell the folk had not yet gone to bed; so he went in and saw an old dame bustling about and minding the house.<p>"Good evening!" said the youth.<p>"Good evening!" said the old dame.<p>"Hutetu! it&#039;s such foul weather out of doors to-night," said he.<p>"So it is," said she.<p>"Can I get leave to have a bed and shelter here to-night?" asked the youth.<p>"You&#039;ll get no good by sleeping here," said the old dame; for if the folk come home and find you here, they&#039;ll kill both me and you."<p>"What sort of folk, then, are they who live here?" asked the youth.<p>"Oh, robbers! And a bad lot of them too," said the old dame. "They stole me away when I was little, and have kept me as their housekeeper ever since."<p>"Well, for all that, I think I&#039;ll just go to bed," said the youth. "Come what may, I&#039;ll not stir out at night in such weather."<p>"Very well," said the old dame; "but if you stay, it be the worse for you."<p>With that the youth got into a bed which stood there, but he dared not go to sleep, and very soon after in came the robbers; so the old dame told them how a stranger fellow had come in whom she had not been able to get out of the house again.<p>"Did you see if he had any money?" said the robbers.<p>"Such a one as he money!" said the old dame, "the tramper! Why, if he had clothes to his back, it was as much as he had."<p>Then the robbers began to talk among themselves what they should do with him; if they should kill him outright, or what else they should do. Meantime the youth got up and began to talk to them, and to ask if they didn&#039;t want a servant, for it might be that he would be glad to enter their service.<p>"Oh," said they, "if you have a mind to follow the trade that we follow, you can very well get a place here."<p>"It&#039;s all one to me what trade I follow," said the youth; "for when I left home father gave me leave to take to any trade I chose."<p>"Well, have you a mind to steal?" asked the robbers.<p>"I don&#039;t care," said the youth, for he thought it would not take long to learn that trade.<p>Now there lived a man a little way off who had three oxen. One of these he was to take to the town to sell, and the robbers had heard what he was going to do, so they said to the youth, if he were good to steal the ox from the man by the way without his knowing it, and without doing him any harm, they would give him leave to be their serving-man.<p>Well, the youth set off, and took with him a pretty shoe with a silver buckle on it, which lay about the house; and he put the shoe in the road along which the man was going with his ox; and when he had done that, he went into the wood and hid himself under a bush. So when the man came by he saw the shoe at once.<p>"That&#039;s a nice shoe," said he. "If I only had the fellow to it, I&#039;d take it home, with me, and perhaps I&#039;d put my old dame in a good humour for once." For you must know he had an old wife, so cross and snappish, it was not long between each time that she boxed his ears. But then he bethought him that he could do nothing with the odd shoe unless he had the fellow to it; so he went on his way and let the shoe lie on the road.<p>Then the youth took up the shoe, aud made all the haste he could to get before the man by a short cut through the wood, and laid it down before him in the road again. When the man came along with his ox, he got quite angry with himself for being so dull as to leave the fellow to the shoe lying in the road instead of taking it with him; so he tied the ox to the fence, and said to himself, "I may just as well run back and pick up the other, and then I&#039;ll have a pair of good shoes for my old dame, and so, perhaps, I&#039;ll get a kind word from her for once."<p>So he set off, and hunted and hunted up and down for the shoe, but no shoe did he find; and at length he had to go back with the one he had. But, meanwhile, the youth had taken the ox and gone off with it; and when the man came and saw his ox gone, he began to cry and bewail, for he was afraid his old dame would kill him outright when she came to know that the ox was lost. But just then it came across his mind that he would go home and take the second ox, and drive it to the town, and not let his old dame know anything about the matter. So he did this, and went home and took the ox without his dame&#039;s knowing it, and set off with it to the town. But the robbers knew all about it, and they said to the youth, if he could get this ox too, without the man&#039;s knowing it, and without his doing him any harm, he should be as good as any one of them. If that were all, the youth said, he did not think it a very hard thing.<p>This time he took with him a rope, and hung himself up under the armpits to a tree right in the man&#039;s way. So the man came along with his ox, and when he saw such a sight hanging there he began to feel a little queer.<p>"Well," said he, "whatever heavy thoughts you had who have hanged yourself up there, it can&#039;t be helped; you may hang for what I care! I can&#039;t breathe life into you again;" and with that he went on his way with his ox. Down slipped the youth from the tree, and ran by a footpath, and got before the man, and hung himself up right in his way again.<p>"Bless me!" said the man, "were you really so heavy at heart that you hanged yourself up there—or is it only a piece or witchcraft that I see before me? Ay, ay! you may hang for all I care, whether you are a ghost, or whatever you are." So he passed on with his ox.<p>Now the youth did just as he had done twice before; he jumped down from the tree, ran through the wood by a footpath, and hung himself up right in the man&#039;s way again. But when the man saw this sight for the third time, he said to himself,—<p>"Well, this is an ugly business! Is it likely now that they should have been so heavy at heart as to hang themselves all these three? No! I cannot think it is anything else than a piece of witchcraft that I see. But now I&#039;ll soon know for certain; if the other two are still hanging there, it must be really so; but if they are not, then it can be nothing but witchcraft that I see."<p>So he tied up his ox, and ran back to see if the others were still really hanging there. But while he went and peered up into all the trees, the youth jumped down and took his ox and ran off with it. When the man came back and found his ox gone, he was in a sad plight, and, as any one might know without being told, he began to cry and bemoan; but at last he came to take it easier, and so he thought,—<p>"There&#039;s no other help for it than to go home and take the third ox without my dame&#039;s knowing it, and to try and drive a good bargain with it, so that I may get a good sum of money for it."<p>So he went home and set off with the ox, and his old dame knew never a word about the matter. But the robbers, they knew all about it, and they said to the youth, that if he could steal this ox as he had stolen the other two, then he should be master over the whole band. Well, the youth set off, and ran into the wood; and as the man came by with his ox he set up a dreadful bellowing, just like a great ox in the wood. When the man heard that, you can&#039;t think how glad he was, for it seemed to him that he knew the voice of his big bullock, and he thought that, now he should find both of them again; so he tied up the third ox, and ran off from the road to look for them in the wood; but meantime the youth went off with the third ox. Now, when the man came back and found he had lost this ox too, he was so wild that there was no end to his grief. He cried and roared and beat his breast, and, to tell the truth, it was many days before he dared go home; for he was afraid lest his old dame should kill him outright on the spot.<p>As for the robbers, they were not very well pleased either, when they had to own that the youth was master over the whole band. So one day they thought they would try their hands at something which he was not man enough to do; and they set off all together, every man Jack of them, and left him alone at home. Now, the first thing that he did when they were all well clear of the house, was to drive the oxen out to the road, so that they might run back to the man from whom he had stolen them; and right glad he was to see them, as you may fancy. Next he took all the horses which the robbers had, and loaded them with the best things he could lay his hands on—gold and silver, and clothes, and other fine things; and then he bade the old dame to greet the robbers when they came back, and to thank them for him, and to say that now he was setting off on his travels, and they would have hard work to find him again; and with that, off he started.<p>After a good bit he came to the road along which he was going when he fell among the robbers, and when he got near home, and could see his father&#039;s cottage, he put on an uniform which he had found among the clothes he had taken from the robbers, and which was made just like a general&#039;s. So he drove up to the door as if he were any other great man. After that he went in and asked if he could have a lodging. No; that he couldn&#039;t at any price.<p>"How ever should I be able," said the man, "to make room in my house for such a fine gentleman—I who scarce have a rag to lie upon, and miserable rags, too?"<p>"You always were a stingy old hunks," said the youth, "and so you are still, when you won&#039;t take your own son in."<p>"What, you my son!" said the man.<p>"Don&#039;t you know me again?" said the youth. Well, after a little while he did know him again.<p>"But what have you been turning your hand to, that you have made yourself so great a man in such haste?" asked the man.<p>"Oh, I&#039;ll soon tell you," said the youth. "You said I might take to any trade I chose, and so I bound myself apprentice to a pack of thieves and robbers, and now have served my time out, and am become a Master Thief."<p>Now there lived a Squire close by to his father&#039;s cottage, and he had such a great house, and such heaps of money, he could not tell how much he had. He had a daughter too, and a smart and pretty girl she was. So the Master Thief set his heart upon having her to wife, and he told his father to go to the Squire and ask for his daughter for him.<p>"If he asks by what trade I get my living, you can say I&#039;m a Master Thief."<p>"I think you&#039;ve lost your wits," said the man, "for you can&#039;t be in your right mind when you think of such stuff."<p>No, he had not lost his wits; his father must and should go to the Squire and ask for his daughter.<p>"Nay, but I tell you, I daren&#039;t go to the Squire and be your spokesman; he who is so rich, and has so much money," said the man.<p>Yes, there was no help for it, said the Master Thief;<p>he should go whether he would or no; and if he did not go by fair means, he would soon make him go by foul. But the man was still loath to go; so he stopped after him, and rubbed him down with a good birch cudgel, and kept on till the man came crying and sobbing inside the Squire&#039;s door.<p>"How now, my man! what ails you?" said the Squire.<p>So he told him the whole story; how he had three sons who set off one day, and how he had given them leave to go whithersoever they would, and to follow whatever calling they chose. "And here now is the youngest come home, and has thrashed me till he has made me come to you and ask for your daughter for him to wife; and he bids me say, besides, that he&#039;s a Master Thief." And so he fell to crying and sobbing again.<p>"Never mind, my man," said the Squire laughing; "just go back and tell him from me he must prove his skill first. If he can steal the roast from the spit in the kitchen on Sunday, while all the household are looking after it, he shall have my daughter. Just go and tell him that."<p>So he went back and told the youth, who thought it would be an easy job. So he set about and caught three hares alive, and put them into a bag, and dressed himself in some old rags, until he looked so poor and filthy that it made one&#039;s heart bleed to see; and then he stole into the passage at the back-door of the Squire&#039;s house on the Sunday forenoon, with his bag, just like any other beggar-boy. But the Squire himself and all his household were in the kitchen watching the roast. Just as they were doing this, the youth let one hare go, and it set off and ran round and round the yard in front of the house.<p>"Oh, just look at that hare!" said the folk in the kitchen, and were all for running out to catch it.<p>Yes, the Squire saw it running too. "Oh, let it run," said he; "there&#039;s no use in thinking to catch a hare on the spring."<p>A little while after, the youth let the second hare go, and they saw it in the kitchen, and thought it was the same they had seen before, and still wanted to run out and catch it; but the Squire said again it was no use. It was not long before the youth let the third hare go, and it set off and ran round and round the yard as the others before it. Now, they saw it from the kitchen, and still thought it was the same hare that kept on running about, and were all eager to be out after it.<p>"Well, it is a fine hare," said the Squire; "come, let&#039;s see if we can&#039;t lay our hands on it."<p>So out he ran, and the rest with him—away they all went, the hare before, and they after; so that it was rare fun to see. But meantime the youth took the roast and ran off with it; and where the Squire got a roast for his dinner that day I don&#039;t know; but one thing, I know, and that is, that he had no roast hare, though he ran after it till he was both warm and weary.<p>Now it chanced that the Priest came to dinner that day, and when the Squire told him what a trick the Master Thief had played him, he made such game of him that there was no end of it.<p>"For my part," said the Priest, "I can&#039;t think how it could ever happen to me to be made such a fool of by a fellow like that."<p>"Very well—only keep a sharp look-out," said the Squire; "maybe he&#039;ll come to see you before you know a word of it." But the priest stuck to his text,—that he did, and made game of the Squire because he had been so taken in.<p>Later in the afternoon came the Master Thief, and wanted to have the Squire&#039;s daughter, as he had given his word. But the Squire began to talk him over, and said, "Oh, you must first prove your skill a little more; for what you did to-day was no great thing after all. Couldn&#039;t you now play off a good trick on the Priest, who is sitting in there, and making game of me for letting such a fellow as you twist me round his thumb?"<p>"Well, as for that, it wouldn&#039;t be hard," said the Master Thief. So he dressed himself up like a bird, threw a great white sheet over his body, took the wings of a goose, and tied them to his back, and so climbed up into a great maple which stood in the Priest&#039;s garden. And when the Priest came home in the evening, the youth began to bawl out—<p>"Father Laurence! Father Laurence!"—for that was the Priest&#039;s name.<p>"Who is that calling me?" said the Priest.<p>"I am an angel," said the Master Thief, "sent from God to let you know that you shall be taken up alive into heaven for your piety&#039;s sake. Next Monday night you must hold yourself ready for the journey, for I shall come then to fetch you in a sack; and all your gold and your silver, and all that you have of this world&#039;s goods, you must lay together in a heap in your dining-room."<p>Well, Father Laurence fell on his knees before the angel, and thanked him; and the very next day he preached a farewell sermon, and gave it out how there had come down an angel unto the big maple in his garden, who had told him that he was to be taken up alive into heaven for his piety&#039;s sake; and he preached and made such a touching discourse, that all who wore at church wept, both young and old.<p>So the next Monday night came the Master Thief like an angel again, and the Priest fell on his knees and thanked him before he was put into the sack; but when he had got him well in, the Master Thief drew and dragged him over stocks and stones.<p>"OW! OW!" groaned the Priest inside the sack, "wherever are we going?"<p>"This is the narrow way which leadeth unto the kingdom of heaven," said the Master Thief, who went on dragging him along till he had nearly broken every bone in his body. At last he tumbled him into a goose-house that belonged to the Squire, and the geese began pecking and pinching him with their bills, so that he was more dead than alive.<p>"Now you are in the flames of purgatory, to be cleansed and purified for life everlasting," said the Master Thief; and with that he went his way, and took all the gold which the Priest had laid together in his dining-room. The next morning, when the goose-girl came to let the geese out, she heard how the Priest lay in the sack, and bemoaned himself in the goose-house.<p>"In heaven&#039;s name, who&#039;s there, and what ails you?" she cried.<p>"Oh!" said the Priest, "if you are an angel from heaven, do let me out, and let me return again to earth, for it is worse here than in hell. The little fiends keep on pinching me with tongs."<p>"Heaven help us, I am no angel at all," said the girl, as she helped the Priest out of the sack; "I only look after the Squire&#039;s geese, and like enough they are the little fiends which have pinched your reverence."<p>"Oh!" groaned the Priest, "this is all that Master Thief&#039;s doing. All my gold and my silver, and my fine clothes." And he beat his breast, and hobbled home at such a rate that the girl thought he had lost his wits all at once.<p>Now when the Squire came to hear how it had gone with the Priest, and how he had been along the narrow way, and into purgatory, he laughed till he wellnigh split his sides. But when the Master Thief came and asked for his daughter as he had promised, the Squire put him off again, and said—<p>"You must do one masterpiece better still, that I may see plainly what you are fit for. Now, I have twelve horses in my stable, and on them I will put twelve grooms, one on each. If you are so good a thief as to steal the horses from under them, I&#039;ll see what I can do for you."<p>"Very well, I daresay I can do it," said the Master Thief; "but shall I really have your daughter if I can?"<p>"Yes, if you can, I&#039;ll do my best for you," said the Squire.<p>So the Master Thief set off to a shop,and bought brandy enough to fill two pocket-flasks, and into one of them he put a sleepy drink, but into the other only brandy. After that he hired eleven men to lie in wait at night behind the Squire&#039;s stableyard; and last of all, for fair words and a good bit of money, he borrowed a ragged gown and cloak from an old woman; and so, with a staff in his hand, and a bundle at his back, he limped off, as evening drew on, towards the Squire&#039;s stable. Just as he got there they were watering the horses for the night, and had their hands full of work.<p>"What the devil do you want?" said one of the grooms to the old woman.<p>"Oh, oh! hutetu! it is so bitter cold," said she, and shivered and shook, and made wry faces. "Hutetu! it is so cold, a poor wretch may easily freeze to death;" and with that she fell to shivering and shaking again.<p>"Oh! for the love of heaven, can I get leave to stay here a while, and sit inside the stable door?"<p>"To the devil with your leave," said one. "Pack yourself off this minute, for if the Squire sets his eye on you, he&#039;ll lead us a pretty dance."<p>"Oh! the poor old bag of bones," said another, whose heart took pity on her; "the old hag may sit inside and welcome; such a one as she can do no harm."<p>And the rest said, some she should stay and some she shouldn&#039;t; but while they were quarrelling and minding the horses, she crept farther and farther into the stable, till at last she sat herself down behind the door; and when she had got so far, no one gave any more heed to her.<p>As the night wore on, the men found it rather cold work to sit so still and quiet on horseback.<p>"Hutetu! it is so devilish cold," said one, and beat his arms crosswise.<p>"That it is," said another; "I freeze so that my teeth chatter."<p>"If one only had a quid to chow," said a third.<p>Well! there was one who had an ounce or two; so they shared it between them, though it wasn&#039;t much, after all, that each got; and so they chewed and spat, and spat and chewed. This helped them somewhat; but in a little while they were just as bad as ever.<p>"Hutetu" said one, and shivered and shook.<p>"Hutetu," said the old woman, and shivered so, that every tooth in her head chattered. Then she pulled out the flask with brandy in it, and her hand shook so that the spirit splashed about in the flask, and then she took such a gulp, that it went "bop" in her throat.<p>"What&#039;s that you&#039;ve got in your flask, old girl?" said one of the grooms.<p>"Oh, it&#039;s only a drop of brandy, old man," said she.<p>"Brandy! Well, I never! Do let me have a drop," screamed the whole twelve, one after another. "Oh, but it is such a little drop," mumbled the old woman, "it will not even wet your mouths round." But they must and would have it; there was no help for it; and so she pulled out the flask with the sleepy drink in it, and put it to the first man&#039;s lips; then she shook no more, but guided the flask so that each of them got what he wanted, and the twelfth had not done drinking before the first sat and snored. Then the Master Thief threw off his beggar&#039;s rags, and took one groom after the other so softly off their horses, and set them astride on the beams between the stalls; and so he called his eleven men, and rode off with the Squire&#039;s twelve horses.<p>But when the Squire got up in the morning, and went to look after his grooms, they had just begun to come to; and some of them fell to spurring the beams with their spurs, till the splinters flew again, and some fell off, and some still hung on and sat there looking like fools.<p>"Ho! ho!" said the Squire; "I see very well who has been here; but as for you, a pretty set of blockheads you must be to sit here and let the Master Thief steal the horses from between your legs."<p>So they all got a good leathering because they had not kept a sharper look-out.<p>Farther on in the day came the Master Thief again, and told how he had managed the matter, and asked for the Squire&#039;s daughter, as he had promised; but the Squire gave him one hundred dollars down, and said he must do something better still.<p>"Do you think now," said he, "you can steal the horse from under me while I am out riding on his back?"<p>"O, yes! I daresay I could," said the Master Thief, "if I were really sure of getting your daughter."<p>Well, well, the Squire would see what he could do and he told the Master Thief a day when he would be taking a ride on a great common where they drilled the troops. So the Master Thief soon got hold of an old worn-out jade of a mare, and set to work, and made traces and collar of withies and broom-twigs, and bought an old beggarly cart and a great cask. After that he told an old beggar woman he would give her ten dollars if she would get inside the cask, and keep her mouth agape over the taphole, into which he was going to stick his finger. No harm should happen to her; she should only be driven about a little; and if he took his finger out more than once, she was to have ten dollars more. Then he threw a few rags and tatters over himself, and stuffed himself out, and put on a wig and a great beard of goat&#039;s hair, so that no one could know him again, and set off for the common, where the Squire had already been riding about a good bit. When he reached the place, he went along so softly and slowly that he scarce made an inch of way. "Gee up! Gee up!" and so he went on a little; then he stood stock still, and so on a little again; and altogether the pace was so poor it never once came into the Squire&#039;s head that this could be the Master Thief.<p>At last the Squire rode right up to him, and asked if he had seen any one lurking about in the wood thereabouts.<p>"No," said the man, "I haven&#039;t seen a soul."<p>"Harkye, now," said the Squire, "if you have a mind to ride into the wood, and hunt about and see if you can fall upon any one lurking about there, you shall have the loan of my horse, and a shilling into the bargain, to drink my health for your pains."<p>"I don&#039;t see how I can go," said the man, "for I am going to a wedding with this cask of mead, which I have been to town to fetch, and here the tap has fallen out by the way, and so I must go along holding my finger in the taphole."<p>"Ride off," said the Squire; "I&#039;ll look after your horse and cask."<p>Well, on these terms the man was willing to go; but he begged the Squire to be quick in putting his finger into the taphole when he took his own out, and to mind and keep it there till he came back. At last the Squire grew weary of standing there with his finger in the taphole, so he took it out.<p>"Now I shall have ten dollars more!" screamed the old woman inside the cask; and then the Squire saw at once how the land lay, and took himself off home; but he had not gone far before they met him with a fresh horse, for the Master Thief had already been to his house, and told them to send one.<p>The day after he came to the Squire and would have his daughter, as he had given his word; but the Squire put him off again with fine words, and gave him two hundred dollars, and said he must do one more masterpiece. If he could do that, he should have her. Well, well, the Master Thief thought he could do it, if he only knew what it was to be.<p>"Do you think, now," said the Squire, "you can steal the sheet off our bed, and the shift off my wife&#039;s back. Do you think you could do that?"<p>"It shall be done," said the Master Thief. "I only wish I was as sure of getting your daughter."<p>So when night began to fall, the Master Thief went out and cut down a thief who hung on the gallows, and threw him across his shoulders, and carried him off. Then he got a long ladder and set it up against the Squire&#039;s bed-room window, and so climbed up, and kept bobbing the dead man up and down, just for all the world like one that was peeping in at the window.<p>"That&#039;s the Master Thief, old lass!" said the Squire, and gave his wife a nudge on the side. "Now see if I don&#039;t shoot him, that&#039;s all."<p>So saying, he took up a rifle, which he had laid at his bedside.<p>"No, no! pray don&#039;t shoot him after telling him he might come and try," said his wife.<p>"Don&#039;t talk to me, for shoot him I will," said he; and so he lay there and aimed and aimed; but as soon as the head came up before the window, and he saw a little of it, so soon was it down again. At last he thought he had a good aim; "bang" went the gun, down fell the dead body to the ground with a heavy thump, and down went the Master Thief too as fast as he could.<p>"Well," said the Squire, "it is quite true that I am the chief magistrate in these parts; but people are fond of talking, and it would be a bore if they came to see this dead man&#039;s body. I think the best thing to be done is that I should go down and bury him."<p>"You must do as you think best, dear," said his wife. So the Squire got out of bed and went down-stairs, and he had scarce put his foot out of the door before the Master Thief stole in, and went straight upstairs to his wife.<p>"Why, dear, back already!" said she, for she thought it was her husband.<p>"O yes, I only just put him into a hole, and threw a little earth over him. It is enough that he is out of sight, for it is such a bad night out of doors; by and by I&#039;ll do it better. But just let me have the sheet to wipe myself with—he was so bloody— and I have made myself in such a mess with him."<p>So he got the sheet.<p>After a while he said— "Do you know I am afraid you must let me have your night-shift too, for the sheet won&#039;t do by itself; that I can see."<p>So she gave him the shift also. But just then it came across his mind that he had forgotten to lock the house-door, so he must step down and look to that before he came back to bed, and away he went with both shift and sheet.<p>A little while after came the true Squire.<p>"Why! what a time you&#039;ve taken to lock the door, dear!" said his wife; "and what have you done with the sheet and shift?"<p>"What do you say?" said the Squire.<p>"Why, I am asking what you have done with sheet and shift that you had to wipe off the blood," said she.<p>"What, in the Deil&#039;s name!" said the Squire, "has he taken me in this time too?"<p>Next day came the Master Thief and asked for the Squire&#039;s daughter, as he had given his word; and then the Squire dared not do anything else than give her to him, and a good lump of money into the bargain; for, to tell the truth, he was afraid lest the Master Thief should steal the eyes out of his head, and that the people would begin to say spiteful things of him if he broke his word. So Master Thief lived well and happily from that time forward. I don&#039;t know whether he stole any more; but if he did, I am quite sure it was only for the sake of a bit of fun.<br>

The Miser
  A MISER sold all that he had and bought a lump of gold, which he buried in a hole in the ground by the side of an old wall and went to look at daily. One of his workmen observed his frequent visits to the spot and decided to watch his movements. He soon discovered the secret of the hidden treasure, and digging down, came to the lump of gold, and stole it. The Miser, on his next visit, found the hole empty and began to tear his hair and to make loud lamentations. A neighbor, seeing him overcome with grief and learning the cause, said, &quot;Pray do not grieve so; but go and take a stone, and place it in the hole, and fancy that the gold is still lying there. It will do you quite the same service; for when the gold was there, you had it not, as you did not make the slightest use of it.&quot;

The owl
Two or three hundred years ago, when people were far from being so crafty and cunning as they are now-a-day, an extraordinary event took place in a little town. By some mischance one of the great owls, called horned owls, had come from the neighboring woods into the barn of one of the townsfolk in the night-time, and when day broke did not dare to venture forth again from her retreat, for fear of the other birds, which raised a terrible outcry whenever she appeared. In the morning when the man-servant went into the barn to fetch some straw, he was so mightily alarmed at the sight of the owl sitting there in a corner, that he ran away and announced to his master that a monster, the like of which he had never set eyes on in his life, and which could devour a man without the slightest difficulty, was sitting in the barn, rolling its eyes about in its head. "I know you already," said the master, "you have courage enough to chase a blackbird about the fields, but when you see a dead hen lying, you have to get a stick before you go near it. I must go and see for myself what kind of a monster it is," added the master, and went quite boldly into the granary and looked round him. When, however, he saw the strange grim creature with his own eyes, he was no less terrified than the servant had been. With two bounds he sprang out, ran to his neighbours, and begged them imploringly to lend him assistance against an unknown and dangerous beast, or else the whole town might be in danger if it were to break loose out of the barn, where it was shut up. A great noise and clamour arose in all the streets, the townsmen came armed with spears, hay-forks, scythes, and axes, as if they were going out against an enemy; finally, the senators appeared with the burgomaster at their head. When they had drawn up in the market- place, they marched to the barn, and surrounded it on all sides. Thereupon one of the most courageous of them stepped forth and entered with his spear lowered, but came running out immediately afterwards with a shriek and as pale as death, and could not utter a single word. Yet two others ventured in, but they fared no better. At last one stepped forth; a great strong man who was famous for his warlike deeds, and said, "You will not drive away the monster by merely looking at him; we must be in earnest here, but I see that you have all tuned into women, and not one of you dares to encounter the animal." He ordered them to give him some armour, had a sword and spear brought, and armed himself. All praised his courage, though many feared for his life. The two barn-doors were opened, and they saw the owl, which in the meantime had perched herself on the middle of a great cross-beam. He had a ladder brought, and when he raised it, and made ready to climb up, they all cried out to him that he was to bear himself bravely, and commended him to St. George, who slew the dragon. When he had just got to the top, and the owl perceived that he had designs on her, and was also bewildered by the crowd and the shouting, and knew not how to escape, she rolled her eyes, ruffled her feathers, flapped her wings, snapped her beak, and cried, "Tuwhit, tuwhoo," in a harsh voice. "Strike home! strike home!" screamed the crowd outside to the valiant hero. "Any one who was standing where I am standing," answered he, "would not cry, strike home!" He certainly did plant his foot one rung higher on the ladder, but then he began to tremble, and half-fainting, went back again.<p>And now there was no one left who dared to put himself in such danger. "The monster," said they, "has poisoned and mortally wounded the very strongest man among us, by snapping at him and just breathing on him! Are we, too, to risk our lives?" They took counsel as to what they ought to do to prevent the whole town being destroyed. For a long time everything seemed to be of no use, but at length the burgomaster found an expedient. "My opinion," said he, "is that we ought, out of the common purse, to pay for this barn, and whatsoever corn, straw, or hay it contains, and thus indemnify the owner, and then burn down the whole building, and the terrible beast with it. Thus no one will have to endanger his life. This is no time for thinking of expense, and niggardliness would be ill applied." All agreed with him. So they set fire to the barn at all four corners, and with it the owl was miserably burnt. Let any one who will not believe it, go thither and inquire for himself.

The poor boy in the grave
There was once a poor shepherd-boy whose father and mother were dead, and he was placed by the authorities in the house of a rich man, who was to feed him and bring him up. The man and his wife, had however, bad hearts, and were greedy and anxious about their riches, and vexed whenever any one put a morsel of their bread in his mouth. The poor young fellow might do what he liked, he got little to eat, but only so many blows the more. <p>One day he had to watch a hen and her chickens, but she ran through a quick-set hedge with them, and a hawk darted down instantly, and carried her off through the air. The boy called, "Thief! thief! rascal!" with all the strength of his body. But what good did that do? The hawk did not bring its prey back again. The man heard the noise, and ran to the spot, and as soon as he saw that his hen was gone, he fell in a rage, and gave the boy such a beating that he could not stir for two days. Then he had to take care of the chickens without the hen, but now his difficulty was greater, for one ran here and the other there. He thought he was doing a very wise thing when he tied them all together with a string, because then the hawk would not be able to steal any of them away from him. But he was very much mistaken. After two days, worn out with running about and hunger, he fell asleep; the bird of prey came, and seized one of the chickens, and as the others were tied fast to it, it carried them all off together, perched itself on a tree, and devoured them. The farmer was just coming home, and when he saw the misfortune, he got angry and beat the boy so unmercifully that he was forced to lie in bed for several days.<p>When he was on his legs again, the farmer said to him, "Thou art too stupid for me, I cannot make a herdsman of thee, thou must go as errand-boy." Then he sent him to the judge, to whom he was to carry a basketful of grapes, and he gave him a letter as well. On the way hunger and thirst tormented the unhappy boy so violently that he ate two of the bunches of grapes. He took the basket to the judge, but when the judge had read the letter, and counted the bunches he said, "Two clusters are wanting." The boy confessed quite honestly that, driven by hunger and thirst, he had devoured the two which were wanting. The judge wrote a letter to the farmer, and asked for the same number of grapes again. These also the boy had to take to him with a letter. As he again was so extremely hungry and thirsty, he could not help it, and again ate two bunches. But first he took the letter out of the basket, put it under a stone and seated himself thereon in order that the letter might not see and betray him. The judge, however, again made him give an explanation about the missing bunches. "Ah," said the boy, "how have you learnt that?" The letter could not know about it, for I put it under a stone before I did it." The judge could not help laughing at the boy&#039;s simplicity, and sent the man a letter wherein he cautioned him to keep the poor boy better, and not let him want for meat and drink, and also that he was to teach him what was right and what was wrong.<p>"I will soon show thee the difference," said the hard man, "if thou wilt eat, thou must work, and if thou dost anything wrong, thou shalt be quite sufficiently taught by blows." <p>The next day he set him a hard task. He was to chop two bundles of straw for food for the horses, and then the man threatened: "In five hours," said he, "I shall be back again, and if the straw is not cut to chaff by that time, I will beat thee until thou canst not move a limb." The farmer went with his wife, the man-servant and the girl, to the yearly fair, and left nothing behind for the boy but a small bit of bread. The boy seated himself on the bench, and began to work with all his might. As he got warm over it he put his little coat off and threw it on the straw. In his terror lest he should not get done in time he kept constantly cutting, and in his haste, without noticing it, he chopped his little coat as well as the straw. He became aware of the misfortune too late; there was no repairing it. "Ah," cried he, "now all is over with me! The wicked man did not threaten me for nothing; if he comes back and sees what I have done, he will kill me. Rather than that I will take my own life." <p>The boy had once heard the farmer&#039;s wife say, "I have a pot with poison in it under my bed." She, however, had only said that to keep away greedy people, for there was honey in it. The boy crept under the bed, brought out the pot, and ate all that was in it. "I do not know," said he, "folks say death is bitter, but it tastes very sweet to me. It is no wonder that the farmer&#039;s wife has so often longed for death." He seated himself in a little chair, and was prepared to die. But instead of becoming weaker he felt himself strengthened by the nourishing food. "It cannot have been poison," thought he, "but the farmer once said there was a small bottle of poison for flies in the box in which he keeps his clothes; that, no doubt, will be the true poison, and bring death to me." It was, however, no poison for flies, but Hungarian wine. The boy got out the bottle, and emptied it. "This death tastes sweet too," said he, but shortly after when the wine began to mount into his brain and stupefy him, he thought his end was drawing near. "I feel that I must die," said he, "I will go away to the churchyard, and seek a grave." He staggered out, reached the churchyard, and laid himself in a newly dug grave. He lost his senses more and more. In the neighbourhood was an inn where a wedding was being kept; when he heard the music, he fancied he was already in Paradise, until at length he lost all consciousness. The poor boy never awoke again; the heat of the strong wine and the cold night-dew deprived him of life, and he remained in the grave in which he had laid himself. <p>When the farmer heard the news of the boy&#039;s death he was terrified, and afraid of being brought to justice indeed, his distress took such a powerful hold of him that he fell fainting to the ground. His wife, who was standing on the hearth with a pan of hot fat, ran to him to help him. But the flames darted against the pan, the whole house caught fire, in a few hours it lay in ashes, and the rest of the years they had to live they passed in poverty and misery, tormented by the pangs of conscience.

The seven Swabians
Seven Swabians were once together. The first was Master Schulz; the second, Jackli; the third, Marli; the fourth, Jergli; the fifth, Michal; the sixth, Hans; the seventh, Veitli: all seven had made up their minds to travel about the world to seek adventures, and perform great deeds. But in order that they might go in security and with arms in their hands, they thought it would be advisable that they should have one solitary, but very strong, and very long spear made for them. This spear all seven of them took in their hands at once; in front walked the boldest and bravest, and that was Master Schulz; all the others followed in a row, and Veitli was the last. Then it came to pass one day in the hay-making month (July), when they had walked a long distance, and still had a long way to go before they reached the village where they were to pass the night, that as they were in a meadow in the twilight a great beetle or hornet flew by them from behind a bush, and hummed in a menacing manner. Master Schulz was so terrified that he all but dropped the spear, and a cold perspiration broke out over his whole body. "Hark! hark!" cried he to his comrades, "Good heavens! I hear a drum." Jackli, who was behind him holding the spear, and who perceived some kind of a smell, said, "Something is most certainly going on, for I taste powder and matches." At these words Master Schulz began to take to flight, and in a trice jumped over a hedge, but as he just happened to jump on to the teeth of a rake which had been left lying there after the hay-making, the handle of it struck against his face and gave him a tremendous blow. "Oh dear! Oh dear!" screamed Master Schulz. "Take me prisoner; I surrender! I surrender!" The other six all leapt over, one on the top of the other, crying, "If you surrender, I surrender too! If you surrender, I surrender too!" At length, as no enemy was there to bind and take them away, they saw that they had been mistaken, and in order that the story might not be known, and they be treated as fools and ridiculed, they all swore to each other to hold their peace about it until one of them accidentally spoke of it. Then they journeyed onwards. The second danger which they survived cannot be compared with the first. Some days afterwards, their path led them through a fallow-field where a hare was sitting sleeping in the sun. Her ears were standing straight up, and her great glassy eyes were wide open. All of them were alarmed at the sight of the horrible wild beast, and they consulted together as to what it would be the least dangerous to do. For if they were to run away, they knew that the monster would pursue and swallow them whole. So they said, "We must go through a great and dangerous struggle. Boldly ventured, is half won," and all seven grasped the spear, Master Schulz in front, and Veitli behind. Master Schulz was always trying to keep the spear back, but Veitli had become quite brave while behind, and wanted to dash forward and cried, <p>"Strike home, in every Swabian&#039;s name,<p>Or else I wish ye may be lame."<p>But Hans knew how to meet this, and said,<p>"Thunder and lightning, it&#039;s fine to prate,<p>But for dragon-hunting thou&#039;rt aye too late."<p>Michal cried,<p>"Nothing is wanting, not even a hair,<p>Be sure the Devil himself is there."<p>Then it was Jergli&#039;s turn to speak,<p>"If it be not, it&#039;s at least his mother,<p>Or else it&#039;s the Devil&#039;s own step-brother."<p>And now Marli had a bright thought, and said to Veitli,<p>"Advance, Veitli, advance, advance,<p>And I behind will hold the lance."<p>Veitli, however, did not attend to that, and Jackli said,<p>"Tis Schulz&#039;s place the first to be,<p>No one deserves that honor but he."<p>Then Master Schulz plucked up his courage, and said, gravely,<p>"Then let us boldly advance to the fight,<p>And thus we shall show our valour and might."<p>Hereupon they all together set on the dragon. Master Schulz crossed himself and prayed for God&#039;s assistance, but as all this was of no avail, and he was getting nearer and nearer to the enemy, he screamed "Oho! oho! ho! ho! ho!" in the greatest anguish. This awakened the hare, which in great alarm darted swiftly away. When Master Schulz saw her thus flying from the field of battle, he cried in his joy.<p>"Quick, Veitli, quick, look there, look there,<p>The monster&#039;s nothing but a hare!"<p>But the Swabian allies went in search of further adventures, and came to the Moselle, a mossy, quiet, deep river, over which there are few bridges, and which in many places people have to cross in boats. As the seven Swabians did not know this, they called to a man who was working on the opposite side of the river, to know how people contrived to get across. The distance and their way of speaking made the man unable to understand what they wanted, and he said "What? what?" in the way people speak in the neighborhood of Treves. Master Schulz thought he was saying, "Wade, wade through the water," and as he was the first, began to set out and went into the moselle. It was not long before he sank in the mud and the deep waves which drove against him, but his hat was blown on the opposite shore by the wind, and a frog sat down beside it, and croaked "Wat, wat, wat." The other six on the opposite side heard that, and said, "Oho, comrades, Master Schulz is calling us; if he can wade across, why cannot we?" So they all jumped into the water together in a great hurry, and were drowned, and thus one frog took the lives of all six of them, and not one of the Swabian allies ever reached home again.

The Shepherd&#039;s Boy and the Wolf
  A SHEPHERD-BOY, who watched a flock of sheep near a village, brought out the villagers three or four times by crying out, &quot;Wolf! Wolf!&quot; and when his neighbors came to help him, laughed at them for their pains. The Wolf, however, did truly come at last.  The Shepherd-boy, now really alarmed, shouted in an agony of terror: &quot;Pray, do come and help me; the Wolf is killing the sheep&quot;; but no one paid any heed to his cries, nor rendered any assistance. The Wolf, having no cause of fear, at his leisure lacerated or destroyed the whole flock.  There is no believing a liar, even when he speaks the truth.

The Storehouse Key in the Disdaff
THERE was once a rich farmer&#039;s son who went out to woo. He had heard of a lass who was fair and gentle, and who was both clever in the house and good at cooking.<br>There he went, for it was just such a wife he wanted. The people on the farm knew, of course, on what errand he came, so they asked him to take a seat near to them, and they talked and chatted with him, as the custom is, and beside offered him a drink and asked him to stop to dinner. They went in and out of the room, so the lad had time to look about him, and over in a corner he saw a spinning wheel with the distaff full of flax.<br>"Whose spinning wheel is that?" asked the lad.<br>"Oh, that&#039;s our daughter&#039;s," said the woman of the house.<br>"There&#039;s a deal of flax on it," said the lad; "I suppose she takes more than a day to spin that," said he.<br>"No, not at all," said the woman; "she does it easily in one day and perhaps less than that."<br>That was more than he had ever heard of any one being able to spin in such a short time.<br>When they were going to carry in the dinner they all went out of the room and he was left alone. He then saw an old key lying in the window, and this he took and stowed well away among the flax on the distaff. So they ate and drank and got on well together, and when the lad thought he had been there long enough he said good-by and went his way. They asked him to come soon again, which he promised, but he did not speak of the matter he had at heart, although he liked the lass very well.<br>Some time after he came again to the farm, and they received him still better than the first time. But just as they were chatting at their best the farmer&#039;s wife said:<br>"Last time you were here something very remarkable happened; our storehouse key disappeared all at once and we have never been able to find it since."<br>The lad went over to the spinning wheel, which stood in the corner with just as much flax on it as when last he was there. He put his hand in among the flax and said:<br>"Here is the key! Much cannot be made by the spinning when the spinning day lasts from Michaelmas to Easter."<br>So he said good-by, and did not speak of the matter he had at heart that time either.<br>

The three children of fortune
A father once called his three sons before him, and he gave to the first a cock, to the second a scythe, and to the third a cat. "I am already aged," said he, "my death is nigh, and I have wished to take thought for you before my end; money I have not, and what I now give you seems of little worth, but all depends on your making a sensible use of it. Only seek out a country where such things are still unknown, and your fortune is made."<p>After the father&#039;s death the eldest went away with his cock, but wherever he came the cock was already known; in the towns he saw him from a long distance, sitting upon the steeples and turning round with the wind, and in the villages he heard more than one crowing; no one would show any wonder at the creature, so that it did not look as if he would make his fortune by it.<p>At last, however, it happened that he came to an island where the people knew nothing about cocks, and did not even understand how to divide their time. They certainly knew when it was morning or evening, but at night, if they did not sleep through it, not one of them knew how to find out the time.<p>"Look!" said he, "what a proud creature! it has a ruby-red crown upon its head, and wears spurs like a knight; it calls you three times during the night, at fixed hours, and when it calls for the last time, the sun soon rises. But if it crows by broad daylight, then take notice, for there will certainly be a change of weather."<p>The people were well pleased; for a whole night they did not sleep, and listened with great delight as the cock at two, four, and six o&#039;clock, loudly and clearly proclaimed the time. They asked if the creature were for sale, and how much he wanted for it? "About as much gold as an ass can carry," answered he. "A ridiculously small price for such a precious creature!" they cried unanimously, and willingly gave him what he had asked.<p>When he came home with his wealth his brothers were astonished, and the second said, "Well, I will go forth and see whether I cannot get rid of my scythe as profitably." But it did not look as if he would, for labourers met him everywhere, and they had scythes upon their shoulders as well as he.<p>At last, however, he chanced upon an island where the people knew nothing of scythes. When the corn was ripe there, they took cannon out to the fields and shot it down. Now this was rather an uncertain affair; many shot right over it, others hit the ears instead of the stems, and shot them away, whereby much was lost, and besides all this, it made a terrible noise. So the man set to work and mowed it down so quietly and quickly that the people opened their mouths with astonishment. They agreed to give him what he wanted for the scythe, and he received a horse laden with as much gold as it could carry.<p>And now the third brother wanted to take his cat to the right man. He fared just like the others; so long as he stayed on the mainland there was nothing to be done. Every place had cats, and there were so many of them that new-born kittens were generally drowned in the ponds.<p>At last he sailed over to an island, and it luckily happened that no cats had ever yet been seen there, and that the mice had got the upper hand so much that they danced upon the tables and benches whether the master were at home or not. The people complained bitterly of the plague; the King himself in his palace did not know how to secure himself against them; mice squeaked in every corner, and gnawed whatever they could lay hold of with their teeth. But now the cat began her chase, and soon cleared a couple of rooms, and the people begged the King to buy the wonderful beast for the country. The King willingly gave what was asked, which was a mule laden with gold, and the third brother came home with the greatest treasure of all.<p>The cat made herself merry with the mice in the royal palace, and killed so many that they could not be counted. At last she grew warm with the work and thirsty, so she stood still, lifted up her head and cried, "Mew. Mew!" When they heard this strange cry, the King and all his people were frightened, and in their terror ran all at once out of the palace. Then the King took counsel what was best to be done; at last it was determined to send a herald to the cat, and demand that she should leave the palace, or if not, she was to expect that force would be used against her. The councillors said, "Rather will we let ourselves be plagued with the mice, for to that misfortune we are accustomed, than give up our lives to such a monster as this." A noble youth, therefore, was sent to ask the cat "whether she would peaceably quit the castle?" But the cat, whose thirst had become still greater, merely answered, "Mew! Mew!" The youth understood her to say, "Most certainly not! most certainly not!" and took this answer to the King. "Then," said the councillors, "she shall yield to force." Cannon were brought out, and the palace was soon in flames. When the fire reached the room where the cat was sitting, she sprang safely out of the window; but the besiegers did not leave off until the whole palace was shot down to the ground.

The turnip
There were once two brothers who both served as soldiers; one of them was rich, and the other poor. Then the poor one, to escape from his poverty, put off his soldier&#039;s coat, and turned farmer. He dug and hoed his bit of land, and sowed it with turnip-seed. The seed came up, and one turnip grew there which became large and vigorous, and visibly grew bigger and bigger, and seemed as if it would never stop growing, so that it might have been called the princess of turnips, for never was such an one seen before, and never will such an one be seen again.<p>At length it was so enormous that by itself it filled a whole cart, and two oxen were required to draw it, and the farmer had not the least idea what he was to do with the turnip, or whether it would be a fortune to him or a misfortune. At last he thought, "If thou sellest it, what wilt thou get for it that is of any importance, and if thou eatest it thyself, why, the small turnips would do thee just as much good; it would be better to take it to the King, and make him a present of it."<p>So he placed it on a cart, harnessed two oxen, took it to the palace, and presented it to the King. "What strange thing is this?" said the King. "Many wonderful things have come before my eyes, but never such a monster as this! From what seed can this have sprung, or are you a luck-child and have met with it by chance?" - "Ah, no!" said the farmer, "no luck-child am I. I am a poor soldier, who because he could no longer support himself hung his soldier&#039;s coat on a nail and took to farming land. I have a brother who is rich and well known to you, Lord King, but I, because I have nothing, am forgotten by every one."<p>Then the King felt compassion for him, and said, "Thou shalt be raised from thy poverty, and shalt have such gifts from me that thou shalt be equal to thy rich brother." Then he bestowed on him much gold, and lands, and meadows, and herds, and made him immensely rich, so that the wealth of the other brother could not be compared with his. When the rich brother heard what the poor one had gained for himself with one single turnip, he envied him, and thought in every way how he also could get hold of a similar piece of luck. He would, however, set about it in a much wiser way, and took gold and horses and carried them to the King, and made certain the King would give him a much larger present in return. If his brother had got so much for one turnip, what would he not carry away with him in return for such beautiful things as these? The King accepted his present, and said he had nothing to give him in return that was more rare and excellent than the great turnip. So the rich man was obliged to put his brother&#039;s turnip in a cart and have it taken to his home. When there he did not know on whom to vent his rage and anger, until bad thoughts came to him, and he resolved to kill his brother. He hired murderers, who were to lie in ambush, and then he went to his brother and said, "Dear brother, I know of a hidden treasure, we will dig it up together, and divide it between us." The other agreed to this, and accompanied him without suspicion. While they were on their way, however, the murderers fell on him, bound him, and would have hanged him to a tree. But just as they were doing this, loud singing and the sound of a horse&#039;s feet were heard in the distance. On this their hearts were filled with terror, and they pushed their prisoner head first into the sack, hung it on a branch, and took to flight. He, however, worked up there until he had made a hole in the sack through which he could put his head. The man who was coming by was no other than a travelling student, a young fellow who rode on his way through the wood joyously singing his song. When he who was aloft saw that someone was passing below him, he cried, "Good day! You have come at a lucky time." The student looked round on every side, but did not know whence the voice came. At last he said, "Who calls me?" Then an answer came from the top of the tree, "Raise your eyes; here I sit aloft in the Sack of Wisdom. In a short time have I learnt great things; compared with this all schools are a jest; in a very short time I shall have learnt everything, and shall descend wiser than all other men. I understand the stars, and the signs of the Zodiac, and the tracks of the winds, the sand of the sea, the healing of illness, and the virtues of all herbs, birds, and stones. If you were once within it you would feel what noble things issue forth from the Sack of Knowledge."<p>The student, when he heard all this, was astonished, and said, "Blessed be the hour in which I have found thee! May not I also enter the sack for a while?" He who was above replied as if unwillingly, "For a short time I will let you get into it, if you reward me and give me good words; but you must wait an hour longer, for one thing remains which I must learn before I do it." When the student had waited a while he became impatient, and begged to be allowed to get in at once, his thirst for knowledge was so very great. So he who was above pretended at last to yield, and said, "In order that I may come forth from the house of knowledge you must let it down by the rope, and then you shall enter it." So the student let the sack down, untied it, and set him free, and then cried, "Now draw me up at once," and was about to get into the sack. "Halt!" said the other, "that won&#039;t do," and took him by the head and put him upside down into the sack, fastened it, and drew the disciple of wisdom up the tree by the rope. Then he swung him in the air and said, "How goes it with thee, my dear fellow? Behold, already thou feelest wisdom coming, and art gaining valuable experience. Keep perfectly quiet until thou becomest wiser." Thereupon he mounted the student&#039;s horse and rode away, but in an hour&#039;s time sent some one to let the student out again.

The Valiant Little Tailor
One summer morning a little tailor was sitting on his board near the window, and working cheerfully with all his might, when an old woman came down the street crying, "Good jelly to sell! good jelly to sell!" The cry sounded pleasant in the little tailor&#039;s ears, so he put his head out of the window, and called out, "Here, my good woman, come here, if you want a customer."<p>So the poor woman climbed the steps with her heavy basket, and was obliged to unpack and display all her pots to the tailor. He looked at every one of them, and lifting all the lids, applied his nose to each, and said at last, "The jelly seems pretty good; you may weigh me out four half ounces, or I don&#039;t mind having a quarter of a pound." The woman, who had expected to find a good customer, gave him what he asked for, but went off angry and grumbling. "This jelly is the very thing for me," cried the little tailor; "it will give me strength and cunning; "and he took down the bread from the cupboard, cut a whole round of the loaf, and spread the jelly on it, laid it near him, and went on stitching more gallantly than ever.<p>All the while the scent of the sweet jelly was spreading throughout the room, where there were quantities of flies, who were attracted by it and flew to partake. "Now then, who asked you to come?" said the tailor, and drove the unbidden guests away. But the flies, not understanding his language, were not to be got rid of like that, and returned in larger numbers than before. Then the tailor, not being able to stand it any longer, took from his chimney-corner a ragged cloth, and saying, "Now, I&#039;ll let you have it!" beat it among them unmercifully. When he ceased, and counted the slain, he found seven lying dead before him. "This is indeed somewhat," he said, wondering at his own gallantry; "the whole town shall know this." So he hastened to cut out a belt, and he stitched it^ and put on it in large capitals "Seven at one blow!"<p>"The town, did I say!" said the little tailor; "the whole world shall know it!" And his heart quivered with joy, like a lamb&#039;s tail. The tailor fastened the belt round him, and began to think of going out into the world, for his workshop seemed too small for his worship. So he looked about in all the house for something that it would be useful to take with him, but he found nothing but an old cheese, which he put in his pocket. Outside the door he noticed that a bird had got caught in the bushes, so he took that and put it in his pocket with the cheese. Then he set out gallantly on his way, and as he was light and active he felt no fatigue.<p>The way led over a mountain, and when he reached the topmost peak he saw a terrible giant sitting there, and looking about him at his ease. The tailor went bravely up to him, called out to him, and said, "Comrade, good day! there you sit looking over the wide world! I am on the way thither to seek my fortune: have you a fancy to go with me?"<p>The giant looked at the tailor contemptuously, and said, "You little rascal! you miserable fellow!" - "That may be!" answered the little tailor, and undoing his coat he showed the giant his belt; "you can read there whether I am a man or not!" The giant read: "Seven at one blow!" and thinking it meant men that the tailor had killed, felt at once more respect for the little fellow. But as he wanted to prove him, he took up a stone and squeezed it so hard that water came out of it. "Now you can do that," said the giant, "that is, if you have the strength for it."<p>"That&#039;s not much," said the little tailor, "I call that play," and he put his hand in his pocket and took out the cheese and squeezed it, so that the whey ran out of it. "Well," said he, "what do you think of that?"<p>The giant did not know what to say to it, for he could not have believed it of the little man. Then the giant took up a stone and threw it so high that it was nearly out of sight. "Now, little fellow, suppose you do that!"<p>"Well thrown," said the tailor; "but the stone fell back to earth again, I will throw you one that will never come back." So he felt in his pocket, took out the bird, and threw it into the air. And the bird, when it found itself at liberty, took wing, flew off, and returned no more. "What do you think of that, comrade?" asked the tailor. "There is no doubt that you can throw," said the giant; "but we will see if you can carry." He led the little tailor to a mighty oak-tree which had been felled, and was lying on the ground, and said, "Now, if you are strong enough, help me to carry this tree out of the wood."<p>"Willingly," answered the little man; "you take the trunk on your shoulders, I will take the branches with all their foliage, that is much the most difficult." So the giant took the trunk on his shoulders, and the tailor seated himself on a branch, and the giant, who could not see what he was doing, had the whole tree to carry, and the little man on it as well. And the little man was very cheerful and merry, and whistled the tune: "There were three tailors riding by" as if carrying the tree was mere child&#039;s play. The giant, when he had struggled on under his heavy load a part of the way, was tired out, and cried, "Look here, I must let go the tree!"<p>The tailor jumped off quickly, and taking hold of the tree with both arms, as if he were carrying it, said to the giant, "You see you can&#039;t carry the tree though you are such a big fellow!"<p>They went on together a little farther, and presently they came to a cherry-tree, and the giant took hold of the topmost branches, where the ripest fruit hung, and pulling them downwards, gave them to the tailor to hold, bidding him eat. But the little tailor was much too weak to hold the tree, and as the giant let go, the tree sprang back, and the tailor was caught up into the air. And when he dropped down again without any damage, the giant said to him, "How is this? haven&#039;t you strength enough to hold such a weak sprig as that?"<p>"It is not strength that is lacking," answered the little tailor; "how should it to one who has slain seven at one blow! I just jumped over the tree because the hunters are shooting down there in the bushes. You jump it too, if you can." The giant made the attempt, and not being able to vault the tree, he remained hanging in the branches, so that once more the little tailor got the better of him.<p>Then said the giant, "As you are such a gallant fellow, suppose you come with me to our den, and stay the night." The tailor was quite willing, and he followed him. When they reached the den there sat some other giants by the fire, and each had a roasted sheep in his hand, and was eating it. The little tailor looked round and thought, "There is more elbow-room here than in my workshop." And the giant showed him a bed, and told him he had better lie down upon it and go to sleep. The bed was, however, too big for the tailor, so he did not stay in it, but crept into a corner to sleep.<p>As soon as it was midnight the giant got up, took a great staff of iron and beat the bed through with one stroke, and supposed he had made an end of that grasshopper of a tailor.<p>Very early in the morning the giants went into the wood and forgot all about the little tailor, and when they saw him coming after them alive and merry, they were terribly frightened, and, thinking he was going to kill them, they ran away in all haste.<p>So the little tailor marched on, always following his nose. And after he had gone a great way he entered the courtyard belonging to a King&#039;s palace, and there he felt so overpowered with fatigue that he lay down and fell asleep. In the meanwhile came various people, who looked at him very curiously, and read on his belt, "Seven at one blow!" - "Oh!" said they, "why should this great lord come here in time of peace? what a mighty champion he must be." Then they went and told the King about him, and they thought that if war should break out what a worthy and useful man he would be, and that he ought not to be allowed to depart at any price.<p>The King then summoned his council, and sent one of his courtiers to the little tailor to beg him, so soon as he should wake up, to consent to serve in the King&#039;s army. So the messenger stood and waited at the sleeper&#039;s side until his limbs began to stretch, and his eyes to open, and then he carried his answer back. And the answer was, "That was the reason for which I came," said the little tailor, "I am ready to enter the King&#039;s service." So he was received into it very honourably, and a separate dwelling set apart for him. But the rest of the soldiers were very much set against the little tailor, and they wished him a thousand miles away. "What shall be done about it?" they said among themselves; "if we pick a quarrel and fight with him then seven of us will fall at each blow. That will be of no good to us." So they came to a resolution, and went all together to the King to ask for their discharge. "We never intended," said they, "to serve with a man who kills seven at a blow." The King felt sorry to lose all his faithful servants because of one man, and he wished that he had never seen him, and would willingly get rid of him if he might. But he did not dare to dismiss the little tailor for fear he should kill all the King&#039;s people, and place himself upon the throne.<p>He thought a long while about it, and at last made up his mind what to do. He sent for the little tailor, and told him that as he was so great a warrior he had a proposal to make to him. He told him that in a wood in his dominions dwelt two giants, who did great damage by robbery, murder, and fire, and that no man durst go near them for fear of his life. But that if the tailor should overcome and slay both these giants the King would give him his only daughter in marriage, and half his kingdom as dowry, and that a hundred horsemen should go with him to give him assistance. "That would be something for a man like me 1"thought the little tailor, "a beautiful princess and half a kingdom are not to be had every day."<p>And he said to the King, "Oh yes, I can soon overcome the giants, and yet have no need of the hundred horsemen; he who can kill seven at one blow has no need to be afraid of two."<p>So the little tailor set out, and the hundred horsemen followed him. When he came to the border of the wood he said to his escort, "Stay here while I go to attack the giants." Then he sprang into the wood, and looked about him right and left. After a while he caught sight of the two giants; they were lying down under a tree asleep, and snoring so that all the branches shook. The little tailor, all alive, filled both his pockets with stones and climbed up into the tree, and made his way to an overhanging bough, so that he could seat himself just above the sleepers; and from there he let one stone after another fall on the chest of one of the giants. For a long time the giant was quite unaware of this, but at last he waked up and pushed his comrade, and said, "What are you hitting me for?"<p>"You are dreaming," said the other, "I am not touching you." And they composed themselves again to sleep, and the tailor let fall a stone on the other giant. "What can that be?" cried he, "what are you casting at me?"<p>"I am casting nothing at you," answered the first, grumbling. They disputed about it for a while, but as they were tired, they gave it up at last, and their eyes closed once more. Then the little tailor began his game anew, picked out a heavier stone and threw it down with force upon the first giant&#039;s chest. "This is too much!" cried he, and sprang up like a madman and struck his companion such a blow that the tree shook above them. The other paid him back with ready coin, and they fought with such fury that they tore up trees by their roots to use for weapons against each other, so that at last they both of them lay dead upon the ground. And now the little tailor got down. "Another piece of luck!" said he, "that the tree I was sitting in did not get torn up too, or else I should have had to jump like a squirrel from one tree to another." Then he drew his sword and gave each of the giants a few hacks in the breast, and went back to the horsemen and said, "The deed is done, I have made an end of both of them: but it went hard with me, in the struggle they rooted up trees to defend themselves, but it was of no use, they had to do with a man who can kill seven at one blow."<p>"Then are you not wounded?" asked the horsemen. "Nothing of the sort!" answered the tailor, "I have not turned a hair." The horsemen still would not believe it, and rode into the wood to see, and there they found the giants wallowing in their blood, and all about them lying the uprooted trees. The little tailor then claimed the promised boon, but the King repented him of his offer, and he sought again how to rid himself of the hero. "Before you can possess my daughter and the half of my kingdom," said he to the tailor, "you must perform another heroic act. In the wood lives a unicorn who does great damage; you must secure him."<p>"A unicorn does not strike more terror into me than two giants. Seven at one blow! - that is my way," was the tailor&#039;s answer. So, taking a rope and an axe with him, he went out into the wood, and told those who were ordered to attend him to wait outside.<p>He had not far to seek, the unicorn soon came out and sprang at him, as if he would make an end of him without delay. "Softly, softly," said he, "most haste, worst speed," and remained standing until the animal came quite near, then he slipped quietly behind a tree. The unicorn ran with all his might against the tree and stuck his horn so deep into the trunk that he could not get it out again, and so was taken. "Now I have you," said the tailor, coming out from behind the tree, and, putting the rope round the unicorn&#039;s neck, he took the axe, set free the horn, and when all his party were assembled he led forth the animal and brought it to the King.<p>The King did not yet wish to give him the promised reward, and set him a third task to do. Before the wedding could take place the tailor was to secure a wild boar which had done a great deal of damage in the wood. The huntsmen were to accompany him. "All right," said the tailor, "this is child&#039;s play." But he did not take the huntsmen into the wood, and they were all the better pleased, for the wild boar had many a time before received them in such a way that they had no fancy to disturb him.<p>When the boar caught sight of the tailor he ran at him with foaming mouth and gleaming tusks to bear him to the ground, but the nimble hero rushed into a chapel which chanced to be near, and jumped quickly out of a window on the other side. The boar ran after him, and when he got inside the door shut after him, and there he was imprisoned, for the creature was too big and unwieldy to jump out of the window too. Then the little tailor called the huntsmen that they might see the prisoner with their own eyes; and then he betook himself to the king, who now, whether he liked it or not, was obliged to fulfil his promise, and give him his daughter and the half of his kingdom. But if he had known that the great warrior was only a little tailor he would have taken it still more to heart. So the wedding was celebrated with great splendour and little joy, and the tailor was made into a king.<p>One night the young queen heard her husband talking in his sleep and saying, "Now boy, make me that waistcoat and patch me those breeches, or I will lay my yard measure about your shoulders!" And so, as she perceived of what low birth her husband was, she went to her father the next morning and told him all, and begged him to set her free from a man who was nothing better than a tailor. The king bade her be comforted, saying, "To-night leave your bedroom door open, my guard shall stand outside, and when he is asleep they shall come in and bind him and carry him off to a ship, and he shall be sent to the other side of the world." So the wife felt consoled, but the king&#039;s water-bearer, who had been listening all the while, went to the little tailor and disclosed to him the whole plan. "I shall put a stop to all this," said he.<p>At night he lay down as usual in bed, and when his wife thought that he was asleep, she got up, opened the door and lay down again. The little tailor, who only made believe to be asleep, began to murmur plainly, "Now, boy, make me that waistcoat and patch me those breeches, or I will lay my yard measure about your shoulders! I have slain seven at one blow, killed two giants, caught a unicorn, and taken a wild boar, and shall I be afraid of those who are standing outside my room door?" And when they heard the tailor say this, a great fear seized them; they fled away as if they had been wild hares, and none of them would venture to attack him. And so the little tailor all his lifetime remained a king.

Tom Totherhouse
ONCE on a time there was a Goody who had a deaf husband. A good easy man he was, but that was just why she thought more of the lad next door, whom they called "Tom Totherhouse." Now the lad that served the deaf man saw very well that the two had something between them, and one day he said to the Goody,—<p>"Dare you wager ten dollars, mother, that I don&#039;t make you lay bare your own shame?"<p>"Yes, I dare," said she; and so they wagered ten dollars.<p>So one day, while the lad and the deaf man stood thrashing in the barn, the lad saw that Tom Totherhouse came to see the Goody. He said nothing, but a good while before dinner-time he turned toward the barn-door, and bawled out "Halloa!"<p>"What! are we to go home already?" said the man, who hadn&#039;t given any heed to what the lad did.<p>"Yes, we must, since mother calls," said the lad.<p>So when they got into the passage, the lad began to hem and cough, that the Goody might get Tom Totherhouse out of the way. But when they came into the room, there stood a whole bowl of custards on the table.<p>"Nay, nay, mother," cried out the man, "shall we have custards to-day?"<p>"Yes, that you shall, dear," said the Goody; but she was as sour as verjuice, and as cross as two sticks.<p>So when they had eaten and drank all the good cheer up, off they went again to their work, and the Goody said to Tom,—<p>"Deil take that lad&#039;s sharp nose, this was all his fault; but now you must be off as fast as you can, and I&#039;ll come down to you in the mead with a snack between meals."<p>This the lad stood outside in the passage and listened to.<p>"Do you know, father," he said, "I think we&#039;d best go down into the hollow and put our fence to rights, which is blown down, before the neighbours&#039; swine get in and root up our meadow."<p>"Ay, ay, let&#039;s go and do it," said the man; for he did all he was told, good, easy man.<p>So when the afternoon was half spent, down came the Goody sneaking along into the mead, with something under her apron.<p>"Nay, nay, mother," said the man, "it can&#039;t be you any longer; are we to have a snack between meals too?"<p>"Yes, yes, that you shall," she said: but she was sourer and wilder than ever.<p>So they made merry, and crammed themselves with bannocks and butter, and had a drop of brandy into the bargain.<p>"I&#039;ll go off to Tom Totherhouse with a snack—shan&#039;t I mother?" said the lad. "He&#039;s had nothing between meals, I&#039;ll be bound."<p>"Ah! do; there&#039;s a good fellow," said the Goody, who all at once got as mild as milk.<p>As he went along the lad broke a bannock to bits, and dropped the crumbs here and there as he walked. But when he got to Tom Totherhouse he said—<p>"Now, just you take care, for our old cock has found out that you come too often to see our Goody. He won&#039;t stand it any longer, and has sworn to drive his axe into you as soon as ever he can set eyes on you."<p>As for Tom, he was so frightened he scarce knew which way to turn, and the lad went back again to his master.<p>"There&#039;s something wrong," he said, "with Tom&#039;s plough, and he begs you to be so good as to take your axe, and go and see if you can&#039;t set it right."<p>Yes, the man set off with his axe, but Tom Totherhouse had scarce caught sight of him, before he took to his heels as fast as he could. The man turned and twisted the plough round and round, and looked at it on every side, and when he couldn&#039;t see anything wrong with it he went off home again; but on the way he picked up the bits of broken bannock which the lad had let fall. His old dame stood in the meadow and looked at him as he did this for a while, and wondered and wondered what it could be her husband was gathering up.<p>"Oh, I know," said the lad, "master&#039;s picking up stones, I&#039;ll be bound; for he has marked how often this Tom Totherhouse runs over here; and the old fellow won&#039;t stand it any longer; and now he has sworn to stone mother to death."<p>Off went the Goody as fast as her legs could carry her.<p>"What in the world is it that mother is running after now?" asked the man, when he reached the spot where she had stood.<p>"Oh," said the lad, "maybe the house at home is on fire?"<p>So there ran the husband behind and the Goody before; and as she ran she screeched out,—<p>"Ah! ah! don&#039;t stone me to death; don&#039;t stone me to death! and I&#039;ll give you my word never to let Tom Totherhouse come near me again."<p>"Now the ten dollars are mine," bawled out the lad; and so they were.<br>

What the old man does is always right
I will tell you a story that was told me when I was a little boy. Every time I thought of this story, it seemed to me more and more charming; for it is with stories as it is with many people– they become better as they grow older.<p>I have no doubt that you have been in the country, and seen a very old farmhouse, with a thatched roof, and mosses and small plants growing wild upon it. There is a stork&#039;s nest on the ridge of the gable, for we cannot do without the stork. The walls of the house are sloping, and the windows are low, and only one of the latter is made to open. The baking-oven sticks out of the wall like a great knob. An elder-tree hangs over the palings; and beneath its branches, at the foot of the paling, is a pool of water, in which a few ducks are disporting themselves. There is a yard-dog too, who barks at all corners. Just such a farmhouse as this stood in a country lane; and in it dwelt an old couple, a peasant and his wife. Small as their possessions were, they had one article they could not do without, and that was a horse, which contrived to live upon the grass which it found by the side of the high road. The old peasant rode into the town upon this horse, and his neighbors often borrowed it of him, and paid for the loan of it by rendering some service to the old couple. After a time they thought it would be as well to sell the horse, or exchange it for something which might be more useful to them. But what might this something be?<p>"You&#039;ll know best, old man," said the wife. "It is fair-day to-day; so ride into town, and get rid of the horse for money, or make a good exchange; whichever you do will be right to me, so ride to the fair."<p>And she fastened his neckerchief for him; for she could do that better than he could, and she could also tie it very prettily in a double bow. She also smoothed his hat round and round with the palm of her hand, and gave him a kiss. Then he rode away upon the horse that was to be sold or bartered for something else. Yes, the old man knew what he was about. The sun shone with great heat, and not a cloud was to be seen in the sky. The road was very dusty; for a number of people, all going to the fair, were driving, riding, or walking upon it. There was no shelter anywhere from the hot sunshine. Among the rest a man came trudging along, and driving a cow to the fair. The cow was as beautiful a creature as any cow could be.<p>"She gives good milk, I am certain," said the peasant to himself. "That would be a very good exchange: the cow for the horse. Hallo there! you with the cow," he said. "I tell you what; I dare say a horse is of more value than a cow; but I don&#039;t care for that,– a cow will be more useful to me; so, if you like, we&#039;ll exchange."<p>"To be sure I will," said the man.<p>Accordingly the exchange was made; and as the matter was settled, the peasant might have turned back; for he had done the business he came to do. But, having made up his mind to go to the fair, he determined to do so, if only to have a look at it; so on he went to the town with his cow. Leading the animal, he strode on sturdily, and, after a short time, overtook a man who was driving a sheep. It was a good fat sheep, with a fine fleece on its back.<p>"I should like to have that fellow," said the peasant to himself. "There is plenty of grass for him by our palings, and in the winter we could keep him in the room with us. Perhaps it would be more profitable to have a sheep than a cow. Shall I exchange?"<p>The man with the sheep was quite ready, and the bargain was quickly made. And then our peasant continued his way on the high-road with his sheep. Soon after this, he overtook another man, who had come into the road from a field, and was carrying a large goose under his arm.<p>"What a heavy creature you have there!" said the peasant; "it has plenty of feathers and plenty of fat, and would look well tied to a string, or paddling in the water at our place. That would be very useful to my old woman; she could make all sorts of profits out of it. How often she has said, &#039;If now we only had a goose!&#039; Now here is an opportunity, and, if possible, I will get it for her. Shall we exchange? I will give you my sheep for your goose, and thanks into the bargain."<p>The other had not the least objection, and accordingly the exchange was made, and our peasant became possessor of the goose. By this time he had arrived very near the town. The crowd on the high road had been gradually increasing, and there was quite a rush of men and cattle. The cattle walked on the path and by the palings, and at the turnpike-gate they even walked into the toll-keeper&#039;s potato-field, where one fowl was strutting about with a string tied to its leg, for fear it should take fright at the crowd, and run away and get lost. The tail-feathers of the fowl were very short, and it winked with both its eyes, and looked very cunning, as it said "Cluck, cluck." What were the thoughts of the fowl as it said this I cannot tell you; but directly our good man saw it, he thought, "Why that&#039;s the finest fowl I ever saw in my life; it&#039;s finer than our parson&#039;s brood hen, upon my word. I should like to have that fowl. Fowls can always pick up a few grains that lie about, and almost keep themselves. I think it would be a good exchange if I could get it for my goose. Shall we exchange?" he asked the toll-keeper.<p>"Exchange," repeated the man; "well, it would not be a bad thing."<p>And so they made an exchange,– the toll-keeper at the turnpike-gate kept the goose, and the peasant carried off the fowl. Now he had really done a great deal of business on his way to the fair, and he was hot and tired. He wanted something to eat, and a glass of ale to refresh himself; so he turned his steps to an inn. He was just about to enter when the ostler came out, and they met at the door. The ostler was carrying a sack. "What have you in that sack?" asked the peasant.<p>"Rotten apples," answered the ostler; "a whole sackful of them. They will do to feed the pigs with."<p>"Why that will be terrible waste," he replied; "I should like to take them home to my old woman. Last year the old apple-tree by the grass-plot only bore one apple, and we kept it in the cupboard till it was quite withered and rotten. It was always property, my old woman said; and here she would see a great deal of property– a whole sackful; I should like to show them to her."<p>"What will you give me for the sackful?" asked the ostler.<p>"What will I give? Well, I will give you my fowl in exchange."<p>So he gave up the fowl, and received the apples, which he carried into the inn parlor. He leaned the sack carefully against the stove, and then went to the table. But the stove was hot, and he had not thought of that. Many guests were present– horse dealers, cattle drovers, and two Englishmen. The Englishmen were so rich that their pockets quite bulged out and seemed ready to burst; and they could bet too, as you shall hear. "Hiss-s-s, hiss-s-s." What could that be by the stove? The apples were beginning to roast. "What is that?" asked one.<p>"Why, do you know"– said our peasant. And then he told them the whole story of the horse, which he had exchanged for a cow, and all the rest of it, down to the apples.<p>"Well, your old woman will give it you well when you get home," said one of the Englishmen. "Won&#039;t there be a noise?"<p>"What! Give me what?" said the peasant. "Why, she will kiss me, and say, &#039;what the old man does is always right.&#039;"<p>"Let us lay a wager on it," said the Englishmen. "We&#039;ll wager you a ton of coined gold, a hundred pounds to the hundred-weight."<p>"No; a bushel will be enough," replied the peasant. "I can only set a bushel of apples against it, and I&#039;ll throw myself and my old woman into the bargain; that will pile up the measure, I fancy."<p>"Done! taken!" and so the bet was made.<p>Then the landlord&#039;s coach came to the door, and the two Englishmen and the peasant got in, and away they drove, and soon arrived and stopped at the peasant&#039;s hut. "Good evening, old woman." - "Good evening, old man." - "I&#039;ve made the exchange."<p>"Ah, well, you understand what you&#039;re about," said the woman. Then she embraced him, and paid no attention to the strangers, nor did she notice the sack.<p>"I got a cow in exchange for the horse."<p>"Thank Heaven," said she. "Now we shall have plenty of milk, and butter, and cheese on the table. That was a capital exchange."<p>"Yes, but I changed the cow for a sheep."<p>"Ah, better still!" cried the wife. "You always think of everything; we have just enough pasture for a sheep. Ewe&#039;s milk and cheese, woollen jackets and stockings! The cow could not give all these, and her hair only falls off. How you think of everything!"<p>"But I changed away the sheep for a goose."<p>"Then we shall have roast goose to eat this year. You dear old man, you are always thinking of something to please me. This is delightful. We can let the goose walk about with a string tied to her leg, so she will be fatter still before we roast her."<p>"But I gave away the goose for a fowl."<p>"A fowl! Well, that was a good exchange," replied the woman. "The fowl will lay eggs and hatch them, and we shall have chickens; we shall soon have a poultry-yard. Oh, this is just what I was wishing for."<p>"Yes, but I exchanged the fowl for a sack of shrivelled apples."<p>"What! I really must give you a kiss for that!" exclaimed the wife. "My dear, good husband, now I&#039;ll tell you something. Do you know, almost as soon as you left me this morning, I began to think of what I could give you nice for supper this evening, and then I thought of fried eggs and bacon, with sweet herbs; I had eggs and bacon, but I wanted the herbs; so I went over to the schoolmaster&#039;s: I knew they had plenty of herbs, but the schoolmistress is very mean, although she can smile so sweetly. I begged her to lend me a handful of herbs. &#039;Lend!&#039; she exclaimed, &#039;I have nothing to lend; nothing at all grows in our garden, not even a shrivelled apple; I could not even lend you a shrivelled apple, my dear woman.&#039; But now I can lend her ten, or a whole sackful, which I&#039;m very glad of; it makes me laugh to think about it;" and then she gave him a hearty kiss.<p>"Well, I like all this," said both the Englishmen; "always going down the hill, and yet always merry; it&#039;s worth the money to see it." So they paid a hundred-weight of gold to the peasant, who, whatever he did, was not scolded but kissed.<p>Yes, it always pays best when the wife sees and maintains that her husband knows best, and whatever he does is right.<p>That is a story which I heard when I was a child; and now you have heard it too, and know that "What the old man does is always right."
