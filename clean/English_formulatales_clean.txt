Nanny Who Wouldn&#039;t Go Home to Supper
There was once upon a time a woman who had a son and a goat. The son was called Espen and the goat they called Nanny. But they were not good friends, and did not get on together, for the goat was perverse and wayward, as goats will be, and she would never go home at the right time for her supper. So it happened one evening that Espen went out to fetch her home, and when he had been looking for her a while he saw Nanny high, high up on a crag:<br>"My dear Nanny, you must not stay any longer up there; you must come home now, it is just supper time. I am so hungry and want my supper."<p>"No, I shan&#039;t," said Nanny, "not before I have finished the grass on this tussock, and that tussock and this and that tussock."<p>"Then I&#039;ll go and tell mother," said the lad.<p>"That you may, and then I shall be left to eat in peace," said Nanny.<p>So Espen went and told his mother.<p>"Go to the fox and ask him to bite Nanny," said his mother.<p>The lad went to the fox. "My dear fox, bite Nanny, for Nanny won&#039;t come home in time. I am so hungry, and I want my supper," said Espen.<p>"No, I don&#039;t want to spoil my snout on pig&#039;s bristles and goat&#039;s beard," said the fox.<p>So the lad went and told his mother.<p>"Well, go to the wolf," said his mother.<p>The lad went to the wolf: "My dear wolf, tear the fox, for the fox won&#039;t bite Nanny, and Nanny won&#039;t come home in time. I am so hungry, and I want my supper."<p>"No," said the wolf, "I won&#039;t wear out my paws and teeth on a skinny fox."<p>So the lad went and told his mother.<p>"Well, go to the bear and ask him to slay the wolf," said the mother.<p>The lad went to the bear. "My dear bear, slay the wolf, for the wolf won&#039;t tear the fox, and the fox won&#039;t bite Nanny, and Nanny won&#039;t come home in time. I am so hungry and want my supper."<p>"No, that I won&#039;t," said the bear; "I don&#039;t want to wear out my claws for that."<p>So the lad went and told his mother.<p>"Well, go to the Finn and ask him to shoot the bear."<p>The lad went to the Finn. "My dear Finn, shoot the bear, for the bear won&#039;t slay the wolf, the wolf won&#039;t tear the fox, the fox won&#039;t bite Nanny, and Nanny won&#039;t come home in time. I am so hungry and want my supper."<p>"No, I will not," said the Finn; "I am not going to shoot away my bullets for that."<p>So the lad went and told his mother.<p>"Well go to the fir," said his mother, "and ask it to crush the Finn."<p>The lad went to the fir tree: "My dear fir, crush the Finn, for the Finn won&#039;t shoot the bear, the bear won&#039;t slay the wolf, the wolf won&#039;t tear the fox, the fox won&#039;t bite Nanny, and Nanny won&#039;t come home in time. I am so hungry and want my supper."<p>"No, I will not," said the fir, "I am not going to break my boughs for that."<p>So the lad went and told his mother.<p>"Well, go to the fire," said his mother, "and ask it to burn the fir."<p>The lad went to the fire: "My dear fire, burn the fir, for the fir won&#039;t crush the Finn, the Finn won&#039;t shoot the bear, the bear won&#039;t slay the wolf, the wolf won&#039;t tear the fox, the fox won&#039;t bite Nanny, and Nanny won&#039;t come home in time. I am so hungry and want my supper."<p>"No, I will not," said the fire, "I am not going to burn myself out for that."<p>So the lad went and told his mother.<p>"Well, go to the water, and ask it to quench the fire," she said.<p>The lad went to the water. "My dear water, quench the fire, for the fire won&#039;t burn the fir, the fir won&#039;t crush the Finn, the Finn won&#039;t shoot the bear, the bear won&#039;t slay the wolf, the wolf won&#039;t tear the fox, the fox won&#039;t bite Nanny, and Nanny won&#039;t come home in time. I am so hungry and want my supper."<p>"No, I will not," said the water, "I am not going to waste myself for that."<p>So the lad went and told his mother.<p>"Well, go to the ox," said she, "and ask him to drink up the water."<p>The lad went to the ox: "My dear ox, drink up the water, for the water won&#039;t quench the fire, the fire won&#039;t burn the fir, the fir won&#039;t crush the Finn, the Finn won&#039;t shoot the bear, the bear won&#039;t slay the wolf, the wolf won&#039;t tear the fox, the fox won&#039;t bite Nanny, and Nanny won&#039;t come home in time. I am so hungry and want my supper."<p>"No, I will not," said the ox. "I&#039;m not going to burst myself for that."<p>So the lad went and told his mother.<p>"Well, go to the yoke," said she, "and ask it to throttle the ox."<p>The lad went to the yoke. "My dear yoke, throttle the ox, for the ox won&#039;t drink the water, the water won&#039;t quench the fire, the fire won&#039;t burn the fir, the fir won&#039;t crush the Finn, the Finn won&#039;t shoot the bear, the bear won&#039;t slay the wolf, the wolf won&#039;t tear the fox, the fox won&#039;t bite Nanny, and Nanny won&#039;t come home in time. I am so hungry and want my supper."<p>"No, I will not," said the yoke. "I&#039;m not going to break myself in two for that."<p>So the lad went and told his mother.<p>"Well, go to the axe," said she, "and tell it to split the yoke."<p>The lad went to the axe. "My dear axe, split the yoke, for the yoke won&#039;t throttle the ox, the ox won&#039;t drink the water, the water won&#039;t quench the fire, the fire won&#039;t burn the fir, the fir won&#039;t crush the Finn, the Finn won&#039;t shoot the bear, the bear won&#039;t slay the wolf, the wolf won&#039;t tear the fox, the fox won&#039;t bite Nanny, and Nanny won&#039;t come home in time. I am so hungry and want my supper."<p>"No, I will not," said the axe. "I am not going to blunt my edge for that."<p>So the lad went and told his mother.<p>"Well, go to the smith," said she, "and ask him to hammer the axe."<p>The lad went to the smith. "My dear smith! hammer the axe, for the axe won&#039;t split the yoke, the yoke won&#039;t throttle the ox, the ox won&#039;t drink the water, the water won&#039;t quench the fire, the fire won&#039;t burn the fir, the fir won&#039;t crush the Finn, the Finn won&#039;t shoot the bear, the bear won&#039;t slay the wolf, the wolf won&#039;t tear the fox, the fox won&#039;t bite Nanny, and Nanny won&#039;t come home in time. I am so hungry and want my supper."<p>"No, I will not," said the smith. "I&#039;ll not burn my coals and wear out my sledge-hammers for that."<p>So the lad went and told his mother.<p>"Well, go to the rope," said she, "and ask it to hang the smith."<p>The lad went to the rope. "My dear rope, hang the smith, for the smith won&#039;t hammer the axe, the axe won&#039;t split the yoke, the yoke won&#039;t throttle the ox, the ox won&#039;t drink the water, the water won&#039;t quench the fire, the fire won&#039;t burn the fir, the fir won&#039;t crush the Finn, the Finn won&#039;t shoot the bear, the bear won&#039;t slay the wolf, the wolf won&#039;t tear the fox, the fox won&#039;t bite Nanny, and Nanny won&#039;t come home in time. I am so hungry and want my supper."<p>"No, I will not," said the rope. "I&#039;m not going to break in two for that."<p>So the lad went and told his mother.<p>"Well, go to the mouse," said she, "and ask her to gnaw the rope."<p>The lad went to the mouse. "My dear mouse, gnaw the rope, for the rope won&#039;t hang the smith, the smith won&#039;t hammer the axe, the axe won&#039;t split the yoke, the yoke won&#039;t throttle the ox, the ox won&#039;t drink the water, the water won&#039;t quench the fire, the fire won&#039;t burn the fir, the fir won&#039;t crush the Finn, the Finn won&#039;t shoot the bear, the bear won&#039;t slay the wolf, the wolf won&#039;t tear the fox, the fox won&#039;t bite Nanny, and Nanny won&#039;t come home in time. I am so hungry and want my supper."<p>"No, I will not," said the mouse. "I&#039;m not going to wear out my teeth for that."<p>So the lad went and told his mother.<p>"Well, go to the cat," said she, "and ask her to catch the mouse."<p>The lad went to the cat. "My dear cat, catch the mouse, for the mouse won&#039;t gnaw the rope, the rope won&#039;t hang the smith, the smith won&#039;t hammer the axe, the axe won&#039;t split the yoke, the yoke won&#039;t throttle the ox, the ox won&#039;t drink the water, the water won&#039;t quench the fire, the fire won&#039;t burn the fir, the fir won&#039;t crush the Finn, the Finn won&#039;t shoot the bear, the bear won&#039;t slay the wolf, the wolf won&#039;t tear the fox, the fox won&#039;t bite Nanny, and Nanny won&#039;t come home in time. I am so hungry and want my supper."<p>"Yes, but give me a drop of milk for my kittens, and then" said the cat.<p>Yes, that she should have. So the cat caught the mouse, and the mouse gnawed the rope, and the rope hanged the smith, and the smith hammered the axe, and the axe split the yoke, and the yoke throttled the ox, and the ox drank the water, and the water quenched the fire, and the fire burned the fir, and the fir crushed the Finn, and the Finn shot the bear, and the bear slew the wolf, and the wolf tore the fox, and the fox bit Nanny, and Nanny took to her heels, scampered home, and ran against the barn wall and broke one of her legs.<p>"M-a-h-a-h!" bleated the goat. There she lay, and if she isn&#039;t dead she is still limping about on three legs. But Espen said it served her right, because she would not come home in time for supper that day.<br>

The Box With Something Pretty In It
Once on a time there was a little boy who was out walking on the road, and when he had walked a bit he found a box.<p>&#039;I am sure there must be something pretty in this box,&#039; he said to himself; but however much he turned it, and however much he twisted it, he was not able to get it open.<p>But when he had walked a bit farther, he found a little tiny key. Then he got tired and sat down, and all at once he thought what fun it would be if the key fitted the box, for it had a little key-hole in it. So he took the little key out of his pocket, and then he blew first into the pipe of the key, and afterwards into the key-hole, and then he put the key into the key-hole and turned it. &#039;Snap&#039; it went within the lock; and when he tried the hasp, the box was open.<p>But can you guess what there was in the box? Why a cow&#039;s tail; and if the cow&#039;s tail had been longer, this story would have been longer too.<br>

The Cock and Hen
Hen—"You promise me shoes year after year, year after year, and yet I get no shoes!"<p>Cock—"You shall have them, never fear! Henny penny!"<p>Hen—"I lay egg after egg, egg after egg, and yet I go about barefoot!"<p>Cock—Well, take your eggs, and be off to the tryst, and buy yourself shoes, and don’t go any longer barefoot!"<br>

The Cock and Hen a-Nutting
ONCE on a time the cock and the hen went out into the hazel-wood to pick nuts; and so the hen got a nutshell in her throat, and lay on her back, flapping her wings.<p>Off went the cock to fetch water for her; so he came to the Spring and said,—<p>"Dear good friend Spring, give me a drop of water, that I may give it to Dame Partlet my mate, who lies at death&#039;s door in the hazel-wood."<p>But the Spring answered,—<p>"You&#039;ll get no water from me until I get leaves from you."<p>So the Cock ran to the Linden and said,—<p>"Dear good friend Linden, give me some of your leaves, the leaves I&#039;ll give to the Spring, and the Spring&#039;ll give me water to give to Dame Partlet my mate, who lies at death&#039;s door in the hazel-wood."<p>"You&#039;ll get no leaves from me," said the Linden, "until I get a red ribbon with a golden edge from you."<p>So the cock ran to the Virgin Mary.<p>"Dear good Virgin Mary, give me a red ribbon with a golden edge, and I&#039;ll give the red ribbon to the Linden, the Linden&#039;ll give me leaves, the leaves I&#039;ll give to the Spring, the Spring&#039;ll give me water, and the water I&#039;ll give to Dame Partlet my mate, who lies at death&#039;s door in the hazel-wood."<p>"You&#039;ll get no red ribbon from me," answered the Virgin Mary, "until I get shoes from you."<p>So the Cock ran to the Shoemaker and said,—<p>"Dear good friend Shoemaker, give me shoes, and I&#039;ll give the shoes to the Virgin Mary, the Virgin Mary&#039;ll give me a red ribbon, the red ribbon I&#039;ll give to the Linden, the Linden&#039;ll give me leaves, the leaves I&#039;ll give to the Spring, the Spring&#039;ll give me water, the water I&#039;ll give to Dame Partlet my mate, who lies at death&#039;s door in the hazel-wood."<p>"You&#039;ll get no shoes from me," said the Shoemaker, "until I get bristles from you."<p>So the Cock ran to the Sow and said,— "Dear good friend Sow, give me bristles, the bristles I&#039;ll give to the Shoemaker, the Shoemaker&#039;ll give me shoes, the shoes I&#039;ll give to the Virgin Mary, the Virgin Mary&#039;ll give me a red ribbon, the red ribbon I&#039;ll give to the Linden, the Linden&#039;ll give me leaves, the leaves I&#039;ll give to the Spring, the Spring&#039;ll give me water, the water I&#039;ll give to Dame Partlet my mate, who lies at death&#039;s door in the hazel-wood."<p>"You&#039;ll get no bristles from me," said the Sow, "until I get corn from you."<p>So the Cock ran to the Thresher and said,—<p>"Dear good friend Thresher, give me corn, the corn I&#039;ll give to the Sow, the Sow&#039;ll give me bristles, the bristles I&#039;ll give to the Shoemaker, the Shoemaker&#039;ll give me shoes, the shoes I&#039;ll give to the Virgin Mary, the Virgin Mary&#039;ll give me a red ribbon, the red ribbon I&#039;ll give to the Linden, the Linden&#039;ll give me leaves, the leaves I&#039;ll give to the Spring, the Spring&#039;ll give me water, the water I&#039;ll give to Dame Partlet my mate, who lies at death&#039;s door in the hazel-wood."<p>"You&#039;ll get no corn from me," said the Thresher, "until I get a bannock from you."<p>So the Cock ran to the Baker&#039;s wife and said,—<p>"Dear good friend Mrs. Baker, give me a bannock, the bannock I&#039;ll give to the Thresher, the Thresher&#039;ll give me corn, the corn I&#039;ll give to the Sow, the Sow&#039;ll give me bristles, the bristles I&#039;ll give to the Shoemaker, the Shoemaker&#039;ll give me shoes, the shoes I&#039;ll give to the Virgin Mary, the Virgin Mary&#039;ll give me a red

Partlet my mate, who lies at death&#039;s door in the hazel-wood."<p>"You&#039;ll get no bannock from me," said the Baker&#039;s wife, "until I get wood from you."<p>So the Cock ran to the Woodcutter and said,—<p>"Dear good friend Woodcutter, give me wood, the wood I&#039;ll give to the Baker&#039;s wife, the Baker&#039;s wife&#039;ll give me a bannock, the bannock I&#039;ll give to the Thresher, the Thresher&#039;ll give me corn, the corn I&#039;ll give to the Sow, the Sow&#039;ll give me bristles, the bristles I&#039;ll give to the Shoemaker, the Shoemaker&#039;ll give me shoes, the shoes I&#039;ll give to the Virgin Mary, the Virgin Mary&#039;ll give me a red ribbon, the red ribbon I&#039;ll give to the Linden, the Linden&#039;ll give me leaves, the leaves I&#039;ll give to the Spring, the Spring&#039;ll give me water, the water I&#039;ll give to Dame Partlet my mate, who lies at death&#039;s door in the hazel-wood."<p>"You&#039;ll get no wood from me," answered the Woodcutter, "until I get an axe from you."<p>So the Cock ran to the Smith and said,—<p>"Dear good friend Smith, give me an axe, the axe I&#039;ll give to the Woodcutter, the Woodcutter&#039;ll give me wood, the wood I&#039;ll give to the Baker&#039;s wife, the Baker&#039;s wife&#039;ll give me a bannock, the bannock I&#039;ll give to the Thresher, the Thresher&#039;ll give me corn, the corn I&#039;ll give to the Sow, the Sow&#039;ll give me bristles, the bristles I&#039;ll give to the Shoemaker, the Shoemaker&#039;ll give me shoes, the shoes I&#039;ll give to the Virgin Mary, the Virgin Mary&#039;ll give me a red ribbon, the red ribbon I&#039;ll give to the Linden, the Linden&#039;ll give me leaves, the leaves I&#039;ll give to the Spring, the Spring&#039;ll give me water, the water I&#039;ll give to Dame Partlet my mate, who lies at death&#039;s door in the hazel-wood."<p>"You&#039;ll get no axe from me," answered the Smith, "until I get charcoal from you."<p>So the Cock ran to the Charcoal-burner and said,—<p>"Dear good friend Charcoal-burner, give me charcoal, the charcoal I&#039;ll give to the Smith, the Smith&#039;ll give me an axe, the axe I&#039;ll give to the Woodcutter, the Woodcutter&#039;ll give me wood, the wood I&#039;ll give to the Baker&#039;s wife, the Baker&#039;s wife&#039;ll give me a bannock, the bannock I&#039;ll give to the Thresher, the Thresher&#039;ll give me corn, the corn I&#039;ll give to the Sow, the Sow&#039;ll give me bristles, the bristles I&#039;ll give to the Shoemaker, the Shoemaker&#039;ll give me shoes, the shoes I&#039;ll give to the Virgin Mary, the Virgin Mary&#039;ll give me a red ribbon, the red ribbon I&#039;ll give to the Linden, the Linden&#039;ll give me leaves, the leaves I&#039;ll give to the Spring, the Spring&#039;ll give me water, the water I&#039;ll give to Dame Partlet my mate, who lies at death&#039;s door in the hazel-wood."<p>So the Charcoal-burner took pity on the Cock, and gave him a bit of charcoal, and then the Smith got his coal, and the Woodcutter his axe, and the Baker&#039;s wife her wood, and the Thresher his bannock, and the Sow her corn, and the Shoemaker his bristles, and the Virgin Mary her shoes, and the Linden its red ribbon with a golden edge, and the Spring its leaves, and the Cock his drop of water, and he gave it to Dame Partlet, his mate, who lay there at death&#039;s door in the hazel-wood, and so she got all right again.<br>

The Cock Who Fell into the Brewing Vat
Once upon a time there was a cook and a hen, who were out in a field scratching and scraping and pecking.<br>All at once the hen found a barleycorn, and the cock found a bur of hops, and so they made up their minds they would make some malt and brew beer for Christmas.<p>"I plucked the barley and I malted the corn and brewed the beer, and the beer is good," cackled the hen.<p>"Is the wort strong enough?" said the cock, and flew up to the edge of the vat to taste it; but when he stooped down to take a sip he began flapping with his wings and fell on his head into the vat and was drowned.<p>When the hen saw this she was quite beside herself. She flew onto the hearth and began to scream and cry, "Got, got, got, drowned! Got, got, got, drowned!" And this she went on crying all the time and would not stop.<p>"What is the matter with you, Mother Tup, since you are crying and grieving so?" asked the hand-quern.<p>"Oh, Father Tup has fallen into the brewing vat and got drowned and there he lies dead!" said the hen. "That&#039;s the reason I cry and grieve."<p>"Well, if I can&#039;t do anything else I will grind and groan," said the hand-quern, and began grinding as fast as it could.<p>When the stool heard this it said, "What&#039;s the matter with you, quern, since you groan and grind so fast?"<p>"Oh, Father Tup has fallen into the brewing vat and got drowned; Mother Tup is sitting on the hearth, crying and grieving; therefore I grind and groan," said the hand-quern.<p>"Well, if I can&#039;t do anything else I shall creak," said the stool, and began creaking and cracking.<p>This the door heard, so it said, "What&#039;s the matter with you? Why are you creaking, stool?"<p>"Oh, Father Tup has fallen into the brewing vat and got drowned; Mother Tup is sitting on the hearth crying and grieving and the hand-quern is grinding and groaning; therefore I creak and crack and crackle," said the stool.<p>"Well, if I can&#039;t do anything else I&#039;ll bang and slam and whine and whistle" said the door, and began opening and shutting and slamming and banging till it went through one&#039;s bones and marrow to hear it.<p>This the dustbin heard.<p>"Why are you slamming and banging like that, door?" said the bin.<p>"Oh, Father Tup fell into the brewing vat and got drowned; Mother Tup is sitting on the hearth crying and grieving; the hand-quern is grinding and groaning; the stool is creaking and cracking; therefore I keep slamming and banging," said the door.<p>"Well, if I can&#039;t do anything else I&#039;ll fume and smoke," said the dustbin, and began fuming and smoking and sending the dust up in clouds all over the room.<p>This the hay-rake saw, as it stood peeping in through the window.<p>"Why are you raising the dust like that, dustbin?" asked the rake.<p>"Oh, Father Tup fell into the brewing vat and got drowned; Mother Tup is sitting on the hearth crying and grieving; the hand-quern is grinding and groaning; the stool is creaking and cracking; the door is slamming and banging; therefore I keep fuming and smoking," said the dustbin.<p>"Well, if I can&#039;t do anything else I&#039;ll rake and rend," said the rake, and began rending and raking.<p>This the aspen tree saw as it looked on.<p>"Why do you rend and rake like that, rake? said the tree.<p>"Oh, Father Tup fell into the brewing vat and got drowned; Mother Tup is sitting on the hearth crying and grieving; the hand-quern is grinding and groaning; the stool is creaking and cracking; the door is slamming and banging; the dustbin is fuming and smoking; therefore I keep rending and raking," said the rake.<p>"Well, if I can&#039;t do anything else," said the aspen, "I will quiver and quake."<p>This the birds noticed. "Why do you quiver and quake like that?" said the birds to the tree.<p>"Oh, Father Tup fell into the brewing vat and got drowned; Mother Tup is sitting on the hearth crying and grieving; the hand-quern is grinding and groaning; the stool is creaking and cracking; the door is slamming and banging; the dustbin is fuming and smoking; the rake is rending and raking; therefore I quiver and quake," said the aspen.<p>"Well, if we can&#039;t do anything else we will pluck off our feathers," said the birds, and began pecking and plucking till the feathers flew about the farm like snow.<p>The farmer stood looking on, and when he saw the feathers flying about he asked the birds, "Why are you plucking off your feathers like that, birds?"<p>"Oh, Father Tup fell into the brewing vat and got drowned; Mother Tup is sitting on the hearth crying and grieving; the hand-quern is grinding and groaning; the stool is creaking and cracking; the door is slamming and banging; the dustbin is fuming and smoking; the rake is rending and raking; the aspen is quivering and quaking; therefore we keep pecking and plucking," said the birds.<p>"Well, if I can&#039;t do anything else I will pull the besoms to pieces," said the farmer, and began tugging and pulling the besoms to pieces, so that the twigs flew about, both east and west.<p>His wife was boiling the porridge for supper when she saw this. "Why are you pulling the besoms to pieces, husband?" said she.<p>"Oh, Father Tup fell into the brewing vat and got drowned; Mother Tup is sitting on the hearth crying and grieving; the hand-quern is grinding and groaning; the stool is creaking and cracking; the door is slamming and banging; the dustbin is fuming and smoking; the rake is rending and raking; the aspen is quivering and quaking; the birds are pecking and plucking off their feathers; therefore I am pulling the besom to pieces," said the man.<p>"Well, then I&#039;ll daub the walls all over with porridge," she said. And she set about it there and then, and took one ladleful after another and smeared the porridge all over the walls, so that no one could see what they were made of.<p>Then they kept the burial feast of the cock who fell into the brewing vat. And if you don&#039;t believe it, you had better go there and taste both the beer and the porridge.<br>

The crumbs on the table
A countryman one day said to his little puppies: "Come into the parlour and enjoy yourselves, and pick up the bread-crumbs on the table; your mistress has gone out to pay some visits." Then the little dogs said: "No, no, we will not go. If the mistress gets to know it, she will beat us." The countryman said: "She will know nothing about it. Do come; after all, she never gives you anything good." Then the little dogs again said: "Nay, nay, we must let it alone; we must not go." But the countryman let them have no peace until at last they went, and got on the table, and ate up the bread-crumbs with all their might. But at that very moment the mistress came, and seized the stick in great haste, and beat them and treated them very hardly. And when they were outside the house, the little dogs said to the countryman: "Dost, dost, dost, dost, dost thou see?" Then the countryman laughed and said: "Didn&#039;t, didn&#039;t, didn&#039;t, you expect it?" So they just had to run away.

The death of the little hen
Once upon a time the little hen went with the little cock to the nut-hill, and they agreed together that whichsoever of them found a kernel of a nut should share it with the other. Then the hen found a large, large nut, but said nothing about it, intending to eat the kernel herself. The kernel, however, was so large that she could not swallow it, and it remained sticking in her throat, so that she was alarmed lest she should be choked. Then she cried, "Cock, I entreat thee to run as fast thou canst, and fetch me some water, or I shall choke." The little cock did run as fast as he could to the spring, and said, "Stream, thou art to give me some water; the little hen is lying on the nut- hill, and she has swallowed a large nut, and is choking." The well answered, "First run to the bride, and get her to give thee some red silk." The little cock ran to the bride and said, "Bride, you are to give me some red silk; I want to give red silk to the well, the well is to give me some water, I am to take the water to the little hen who is lying on the nut-hill and has swallowed a great nut-kernel, and is choking with it." The bride answered, "First run and bring me my little wreath which is hanging to a willow." So the little cock ran to the willow, and drew the wreath from the branch and took it to the bride, and the bride gave him some water for it. Then the little cock took the water to the hen, but when he got there the hen had choked in the meantime, and lay there dead and motionless. Then the cock was so distressed that he cried aloud, and every animal came to lament the little hen, and six mice built a little carriage to carry her to her grave, and when the carriage was ready they harnessed themselves to it, and the cock drove. On the way, however, they met the fox, who said, "Where art thou going, little cock?" - "I am going to bury my little hen." - "May I drive with thee?" - "Yes, but seat thyself at the back of the carriage, for in the front my little horses could not drag thee." Then the fox seated himself at the back, and after that the wolf, the bear, the stag, the lion, and all the beasts of the forest did the same. Then the procession went onwards, and they reached the stream. "How are we to get over?" said the little cock. A straw was lying by the stream, and it said, "I will lay myself across, and you shall drive over me." But when the six mice came to the bridge, the straw slipped and fell into the water, and the six mice all fell in and were drowned. Then they were again in difficulty, and a coal came and said, "I am large enough, I will lay myself across and you shall drive over me." So the coal also laid itself across the water, but unhappily just touched it, on which the coal hissed, was extinguished and died. When a stone saw that, it took pity on the little cock, wished to help him, and laid itself over the water. Then the cock drew the carriage himself, but when he got it over and reached the other shore with the dead hen, and was about to draw over the others who were sitting behind as well, there were too many of them, the carriage ran back, and they all fell into the water together, and were drowned. Then the little cock was left alone with the dead hen, and dug a grave for her and laid her in it, and made a mound above it, on which he sat down and fretted until he died too, and then every one was dead.

The Hare And The Heiress
Once on a time there was a hare, who was frisking up and down under the greenwood tree.<p>&#039;Oh! hurrah! hip, hip, hurrah!&#039; he cried, and leapt and sprang, and all at once he threw a somersault, and stood upon his hind legs. Just then a fox came slouching by.<p>&#039;Good-day, good-day,&#039; said the hare; &#039;I&#039;m so merry to-day, for you must know I was married this morning.&#039;<p>&#039;Lucky fellow you,&#039; said the fox.<p>&#039;Ah, no! not so lucky after all,&#039; said the hare, &#039;for she was very heavy handed, and it was an old witch I got to wife.<p>&#039;Then you were an unlucky fellow,&#039; said the fox.<p>&#039;Oh, not so unlucky either,&#039; said the hare, &#039;for she was an heiress. She had a cottage of her own.&#039;<p>&#039;Then you were lucky after all,&#039; said the fox.<p>&#039;No, no! not so lucky either,&#039; said the hare, &#039;for the cottage caught fire and was burnt, and all we had with it.&#039;<p>&#039;That I call downright unlucky,&#039; said the fox.<p>&#039;Oh, no; not so very unlucky after all,&#039; said the hare, &#039;for my witch of a wife was burnt along with her cottage.&#039;<br>

The Louse and the Flea
A louse and a flea kept house together and were brewing beer in an egg-shell. Then the little louse fell in and burnt herself. On this the little flea began to scream loudly. Then said the little room-door: "Little flea, why art thou screaming?" – "Because the louse has burnt herself."<p>Then the little door began to creak. On this a little broom in the corner said: "Why art thou creaking, little door?" – "Have I not reason to creak?<p>The little louse has burnt herself,<p>The little flea is weeping."<p>So the little broom began to sweep frantically. Then a little cart passed by and said: "Why art thou sweeping, little broom?" – "Have I not reason to sweep?<p>The little louse has burnt herself,<p>The little flea is weeping,<p>The little door is creaking."<p>So the little cart said: "Then I will run," and began to run wildly. Then said the ash-heap by which it ran: "Why art thou running so, little cart?" – "Have I not reason to run?<p>The little louse has burnt herself,<p>The little flea is weeping,<p>The little door is creaking,<p>The little broom is sweeping."<p>The ash-heap said: "Then I will burn furiously," and began to burn in clear flames. A little tree stood near the ash-heap and said: "Ash-heap, why art thou burning?" – "Have I not reason to burn?<p>The little louse has burnt herself,<p>The little flea is weeping,<p>The little door is creaking,<p>The little broom is sweeping,<p>The little cart is running."<p>The little tree said: "Then I will shake myself," and began to shake herself so that all her leaves fell off; a girl who came up with her water-pitcher saw that, and said: "Little tree, why art thou shaking thyself?" – "Have I not reason to shake myself?<p>The little louse has burnt herself,<p>The little flea is weeping,<p>The little door is creaking,<p>The little broom is sweeping,<p>The little cart is running,<p>The little ash-heap is burning."<p>On this the girl said: "Then I will break my little water-pitcher," and she broke her little water-pitcher. Then said the little spring from which ran the water: "Girl, why art thou breaking thy water-jug?" – "Have I not reason to break my water-jug?<p>The little louse has burnt herself,<p>The little flea is weeping,<p>The little door is creaking,<p>The little broom is sweeping,<p>The little cart is running,<p>The little ash-heap is burning,<p>The little tree is shaking itself."<p>"Oh, ho," said the spring, "then I will begin to flow," and began to flow violently. And in the water everything was drowned, the girl, the little tree, the little ash-heap, the little cart, the broom, the little door, the little flea, the little louse, all together.

The nail
A merchant had done good business at the fair; he had sold his wares, and lined his money-bags with gold and silver. Then he wanted to travel homewards, and be in his own house before nightfall. So he packed his trunk with the money on his horse, and rode away.<p>At noon he rested in a town, and when he wanted to go farther the stable-boy brought out his horse and said, "A nail is wanting, sir, in the shoe of its left hind foot." - "Let it be wanting," answered the merchant; "the shoe will certainly stay on for the six miles I have still to go. I am in a hurry."<p>In the afternoon, when he once more alighted and had his horse fed, the stable-boy went into the room to him and said, "Sir, a shoe is missing from your horse&#039;s left hind foot. Shall I take him to the blacksmith?" - "Let it still be wanting," answered the man; "the horse can very well hold out for the couple of miles which remain. I am in haste."<p>He rode forth, but before long the horse began to limp. It had not limped long before it began to stumble, and it had not stumbled long before it fell down and broke its leg. The merchant was forced to leave the horse where it was, and unbuckle the trunk, take it on his back, and go home on foot. And there he did not arrive until quite late at night. "And that unlucky nail," said he to himself, "has caused all this disaster."<p>Hasten slowly.

The Pancake
Once on a time there was a goody who had seven hungry bairns, and she was frying a pancake for them. It was a sweet-milk pancake, and there it lay in the pan bubbling and frizzling so thick and good, it was a sight for sore eyes to look at. And the bairns stood round about, and the goodman sat by and looked on.<p>&#039;Oh, give me a bit of pancake, mother, dear; I am so hungry,&#039; said one bairn.<p>&#039;Oh, darling mother,&#039; said the second.<p>&#039;Oh, darling, good mother,&#039; said the third.<p>&#039;Oh, darling, good, nice mother,&#039; said the fourth.<p>&#039;Oh, darling, pretty, good, nice mother,&#039; said the fifth.<p>&#039;Oh, darling, pretty, good, nice, clever mother,&#039; said the sixth.<p>&#039;Oh, darling, pretty, good, nice, clever, sweet mother,&#039; said the seventh.<p>So they begged for the pancake all round, the one more prettily than the other; for they were so hungry and so good.<p>&#039;Yes, yes, bairns, only bide a bit till it turns itself,&#039;--she ought to have said &#039;till I can get it turned,&#039;--&#039;and then you shall all have some--a lovely sweet-milk pancake; only look how fat and happy it lies there.&#039;<p>When the pancake heard that, it got afraid, and in a trice it turned itself all of itself, and tried to jump out of the pan; but it fell back into it again t&#039;other side up, and so when it had been fried a little on the other side too, till it got firmer in its flesh, it sprang out on the floor, and rolled off like a wheel through the door and down the hill.<p>&#039;Holloa! Stop, pancake!&#039; and away went the goody after it, with the frying-pan in one hand, and the ladle in the other, as fast as she could, and her bairns behind her, while the goodman limped after them last of all.<p>&#039;Hi! won&#039;t you stop? Seize it. Stop, pancake, they all screamed out, one after the other, and tried to catch it on the run and hold it; but the pancake rolled on and on, and in the twinkling of an eye it was so far ahead that they couldn&#039;t see it, for the pancake was faster on its feet than any of them.<p>So when it had rolled awhile it met a man.<p>&#039;Good-day, pancake,&#039; said the man.<p>&#039;God bless you, Manny Panny!&#039; said the pancake.<p>&#039;Dear pancake,&#039; said the man, &#039;don&#039;t roll so fast; stop a little and let me eat you.&#039;<p>&#039;When I have given the slip to Goody Poody, and the goodman, and seven squalling children, I may well slip through your fingers, Manny Panny,&#039; said the pancake, and rolled on and on till it met a hen.<p>&#039;Good-day, pancake,&#039; said the hen.<p>&#039;The same to you, Henny Penny,&#039; said the pancake.<p>&#039;Pancake, dear, don&#039;t roll so fast, bide a bit and let me eat you up,&#039; said the hen.<p>&#039;When I have given the slip to Goody Poody, and the goodman, and seven squalling children, and Manny Panny, I may well slip through your claws, Henny Penny,&#039; said the pancake, and so it rolled on like a wheel down the road.<p>Just then it met a cock.<p>&#039;Good-day, pancake,&#039; said the cock.<p>&#039;The same to you, Cocky Locky,&#039; said the pancake.<p>&#039;Pancake, dear, don&#039;t roll so fast, but bide a bit and let me eat you up.&#039;<p>&#039;When I have given the slip to Goody Poody, and the goodman, and seven squalling children, and to Manny Panny, and Henny Penny, I may well slip through your claws, Cocky Locky,&#039; said the pancake, and off it set rolling away as fast as it could; and when it had rolled a long way it met a duck.<p>&#039;Good-day, pancake,&#039; said the duck.<p>&#039;The same to you, Ducky Lucky.&#039;<p>&#039;Pancake, dear, don&#039;t roll away so fast; bide a bit and let me eat you up.&#039;<p>&#039;When I have given the slip to Goody Poody, and the goodman, and seven squalling children, and Manny Panny, and Henny Penny, and Cocky Locky, I may well slip through your fingers, Ducky Lucky,&#039; said the pancake, and with that it took to rolling and rolling faster than ever; and when it had rolled a long, long while, it met a goose.<p>&#039;Good-day, pancake,&#039; said the goose.<p>&#039;The same to you, Goosey Poosey.&#039;<p>&#039;Pancake, dear, don&#039;t roll so fast; bide a bit and let me eat you up.&#039;<p>&#039;When I have given the slip to Goody Poody, and the goodman, and seven squalling children, and Manny Panny, and Henny Penny, and Cocky Locky, and Ducky Lucky, I can well slip through your feet, Goosey Poosey,&#039; said the pancake, and off it rolled.<p>So when it had rolled a long, long way farther, it met a gander.<p>&#039;Good-day, pancake,&#039; said the gander.<p>&#039;The same to you, Gander Pander,&#039; said the pancake.<p>&#039;Pancake, dear, don&#039;t roll so fast: bide a bit and let me eat you up.&#039;<p>&#039;When I have given the slip to Goody Poody, and the goodman, and seven squalling children, and Manny Panny, and Henny Penny, and Cocky Locky, and Ducky Lucky, and Goosey Poosey, I may well slip through your feet, Gander Pander,&#039; said the pancake, which rolled off as fast as ever.<p>So when it had rolled a long, long time, it met a pig.<p>&#039;Good-day, pancake,&#039; said the pig.<p>&#039;The same to you, Piggy Wiggy,&#039; said the pancake, which, without a word more, began to roll and roll like mad.<p>&#039;Nay, nay,&#039; said the pig, &#039;you needn&#039;t be in such a hurry; we two can then go side by side and see one another over the wood; they say it is not too safe in there.&#039;<p>The pancake thought there might be something in that, and so they kept company. But when they had gone awhile, they came to a brook. As for piggy, he was so fat he swam safe across, it was nothing to him; but the poor pancake couldn&#039;t get over.<p>&#039;Seat yourself on my snout,&#039; said the pig, &#039;and I&#039;ll carry you over.&#039;<p>So the pancake did that.<p>&#039;Ouf, ouf,&#039; said the pig, and swallowed the pancake at one gulp; and then, as the poor pancake could go no farther, why--this story can go no farther either.<br>
